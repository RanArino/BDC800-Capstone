q0,What is the seed lexicon?,a vocabulary of positive and negative predicates that helps determine the polarity score of an event,The seed lexicon consists of 15 positive words and 15 negative words. It is used to assign polarity scores (+1 for positive events and -1 for negative events) to extracted events based on whether their predicates are in the seed lexicon and do not involve complex phenomena like negation.,0.1836734693877551,0.5625,0.27692307692307694,0.020833333333333332,0.06666666666666667,0.031746031746031744,0.14285714285714285,0.4375,0.2153846153846154,0.010956421443241472,0.651644766330719,Yes,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

q4,How big are improvements of supervszed learning results trained on smalled labeled data enhanced with proposed approach copared to basic approach?,3%,"The question is a bit convoluted, but I'll try to provide an answer based on the context.

According to the text, when the models were trained on a small dataset (6,000 events) of labeled data (ACP), and enhanced with additional unlabeled data (AL+CA+CO), the results show that the proposed approach (discourse relation-based label propagation) is effective. However, it does not explicitly mention the size of the improvements.

But we can infer from the text that the performance gaps between the supervised models (ACP) and their semi-supervised counterparts (ACP+AL+CA+CO) were less than 7%. This suggests that the proposed approach made a significant improvement on the results trained on small labeled data, but the exact magnitude of the improvements is not specified.",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0023184451980916686,0.046845197677612305,No,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
