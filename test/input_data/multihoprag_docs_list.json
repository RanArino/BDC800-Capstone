    "content": "SBF\u2019s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\n\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he\u2019s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\n\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\n\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\n\nWithin two years, more than 80 investors provided about $2 billion in capital to FTX, helping Bankman-Fried propel his vision into a reality. In January 2022, the company raised $400 million in a Series C round, boosting its valuation to $32 billion. That was its last round of public funding.\n\nThe company gained somewhat mainstream recognition with branding deals and partnerships. For example, in 2021 it bought the naming rights for the Miami Heat\u2019s home arena. FTX also got its name branded on Major League Baseball umpires\u2019 polos, and it partnered with celebrities like Tom Brady and his ex-wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, as well as Steph Curry, Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Naomi Osaka, among others. He also had close ties to U.S. regulators and government officials, many of whom he donated to.\n\nBankman-Fried was even compared to Warren Buffet and many called him the white horse of crypto (TechCrunch never did, for what it\u2019s worth).\n\nBut in early November 2022, that all changed.\n\nFTX\u2019s collapse\n\nConcerns surrounding FTX\u2019s liquidity grew after CoinDesk published a copy of Alameda\u2019s balance sheet, showing the firm held $14.6 billion in assets and $8 billion in liabilities as of June 30, 2022.\n\nBut there was a problem: The report showed Alameda\u2019s largest asset was $3.66 billion of \u201cunlocked FTT\u201d and $2.16 billion of \u201cFTT collateral.\u201d FTT was the token behind FTX.\n\nThe balance sheet showed that the $5.82 billion in FTT tokens that Alameda owned was 193% higher than the total FTT market cap, which was about $3 billion at the time. That means it purported to have more FTT tokens on its balance sheet than what existed in the world.\n\nAround the same time it was exposed, the world\u2019s largest crypto exchange, Binance, started pulling out its remaining $2.1 billion equivalent of cash in BUSD and FTT. (It had an equity position in FTX from 2019 to 2021.) This essentially triggered a bank run on FTX.\n\nFTX and Alameda filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. mid-November 2022. Bankman-Fried resigned, and John J. Ray III, the Enron turnaround veteran, was appointed its new CEO.\n\nBankman-Fried, however, maintained his innocence. At The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit, he appeared virtually from the Bahamas, saying \u201cI didn\u2019t ever try to commit fraud on anyone; I was shocked by what happened this month.\u201d In a published DM exchange with a Vox reporter, he said he regretted filing for bankruptcy and thought that \u201cregulators make everything worse.\u201d\n\nSBF arrested\n\nBankman-Fried was arrested in December 2022 in the Bahamas, where FTX was based. He was then extradited to the U.S. to face a number of criminal charges. He was released on a $250 million bail bond, and he remained under house arrest at his parents\u2019 home in Palo Alto. This was revoked in August after he was accused of intimidating Alameda\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, by leaking her private diary.\n\nRay represented the company during a House Financial Services Committee hearing regarding FTX. When asked whether the firm had significant risk management systems, Ray said at the time that \u201cthere were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever\u201d and added that he did not \u201ctrust a single piece of paper\u201d in the exchange\u2019s organization. U.S. Attorney Damian Williams called Bankman-Fried\u2019s alleged crimes \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history,\u201d in a press conference.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nFTX co-founder and former CTO Gary Wang, and Alameda Research\u2019s former CEO, Caroline Ellison, both pleaded guilty in December 2022 to federal criminal charges in relation to the FTX collapse. They\u2019re also facing civil penalties from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\n\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\n\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney. If that name sounds familiar, it might be because he also represented Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex trafficking trial related to Jeffrey Epstein. He requested an early release for Bankman-Fried but was denied.\n\nWith the trial beginning, we\u2019re witnessing how FTX\u2019s story ends. But what\u2019s on our mind is what happens to the investors and creditors affected by the collapse? And what happens to the billions in crypto assets tied up in legal proceedings?",

    "content": "Hiya, folks, and welcome to Week in Review (WiR), TechCrunch\u2019s digest of the past week in tech news. It\u2019s TC\u2019s column that highlights the major stories over the past few days, and \u2014 we humbly submit \u2014 it\u2019s a darn useful resource for folks on the go.\n\nThis week, we cover Sam Altman backing a teen\u2019s AI startup, Google\u2019s hardware event (and first impressions of the Pixel 8 Pro), Flexport drama, and the ongoing FTX fallout. Also on the agenda: Gmail\u2019s harsher rules to prevent spam, TikTok testing an ad-free subscription plan, and LinkedIn going big on AI tools. And that\u2019s not all.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t, sign up here to get WiR in your inbox every Saturday. And if you have, our thanks. Now, let\u2019s get on with the news.\n\nMost read\n\nAltman backs teen entrepreneurs: Sam Altman is among the backers of an AI startup, founded by two teenagers, that\u2019s aiming to assist businesses in automating workflows in \u201cpreviously unexplored\u201d ways. Manish writes that Induced AI, founded this year, lets businesses input their back-office tasks in plain English and converts the instructions to pseudo-code in real time.\n\nGoogle unveils new hardware: This week was Google\u2019s annual hardware event, where the search and consumer tech giant showed off what it\u2019s been working on. Christine wrote up a thorough roundup of the news, which included updates on the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Android 14, Pixel Buds, Google Assistant, Bard, Pixel Watch 2 and other goodies.\n\nHands on with the Pixel 8 Pro: Darrell took the newly unveiled Pixel 8 Pro for a whirl, and he liked what he saw. While very similar to last year\u2019s model (the Pixel 7 Pro), Darrell felt that the improved cameras, brighter screen and enhanced AI-powered features made it enough of an upgrade to (potentially) warrant a purchase \u2014 minus the underutilized temperature sensor. Stay tuned for his full review.\n\nTurmoil at Flexport: Dave Clark, the former Amazon executive who was ousted as CEO of Flexport just a year into the job, fired back at its founder and board, calling recent reporting on the logistics company \u201cdeeply concerning.\u201d Clark made the comments Monday in a lengthy post on social media site X following a report from CNBC that provided new information about his last days at Flexport, a freight forwarding and customs brokerage startup valued at $8 billion.\n\nSBF allegedly tried to buy off Trump: The TC team\u2019s been trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced entrepreneur accused of orchestrating the collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX. But fascinating details about SBF\u2019s political dealings are emerging from a book by Michael Lewis, \u201cGoing Infinite,\u201d that debuted on the first day of the trial, like SBF\u2019s attempt to buy off Trump to get him to not run again for president.\n\nGmail fights back against spammers: Google this week announced a series of significant changes to how it handles email from bulk senders in an effort to cut down on spam and other unwanted emails. The company says that, starting next year, bulk senders will need to authenticate their emails, offer an easy way to unsubscribe and stay under a reported spam threshold.\n\nTikTok tests an ad-free tier: TikTok is testing an ad-free subscription tier for some users. For $4.99, subscribers get an ad-free experience on TikTok \u2014 no other strings attached. But don\u2019t look for the option to arrive anytime soon. TikTok says that it\u2019s piloting the plan in a single, English-speaking market outside the U.S. for now.\n\nLinkedIn leans into AI tools: LinkedIn this week unveiled a string of new AI features spanning its job hunting, marketing and sales products, Ingrid writes. They include a big update to its Recruiter talent sourcing platform, with AI assistance built into it throughout; an AI-powered LinkedIn Learning coach; and a new AI-powered tool for marketing campaigns.\n\nMusk comes clean about X\u2019s metrics \u2014 maybe: In September, Elon Musk said that X users were generating a lot of content \u2014 creating 100 million to 200 million posts every day, excluding retweets. But speaking at an event this week, X CEO Linda Yaccarino offered a contradictory figure. She claimed X was seeing 500 million posts per day on the platform. So who\u2019s right? Beats us.\n\nFormer NSA director\u2019s startup shutters: IronNet, a once-promising cybersecurity startup founded by a former NSA director, has shuttered and laid off its remaining staff following its collapse. The Virginia-based IronNet was founded in 2014 by retired four-star general Keith Alexander and had raised more than $400 million in funding. But IronNet failed to gain traction after going public in August 2021, and its stock price continued to steeply decline in the wake of an initial spike.\n\nAudio\n\nOn the hunt for a new podcast to listen to while you work out, do the dishes or rake the leaves (now that fall\u2019s arrived)? Look no further than TechCrunch\u2019s roster, which covers the world of startups, the blockchain and more.\n\nOn Equity this week, the crew talked about the SBF trial; deals from VR firms Rainforest, At One Ventures, Section 32 and Greylock, where venture funding has declined; and how Fearless Fund, a firm founded to invest in women of color, is being barred from awarding grants to Black women founders.\n\nMeanwhile, Found featured Esther Rodriguez-Villegas from Acurable, a medical device company that makes patient-friendly wearable devices to diagnose and manage respiratory conditions at home. As a career-long academic, Rodriguez-Villegas talks about how she never intended to be a founder until she learned about how the currently available medical devices make it extremely difficult to detect and treat diseases like sleep apnea and epilepsy.\n\nAnd over on Chain Reaction, Jacquelyn did a crossover episode with Alex about the SBF trial. Jacquelyn has been on the ground at the Southern District of New York courthouse, listening in to the trial in the same room as Bankman-Fried, so there was lots to talk about.\n\nTechCrunch+\n\nTC+ subscribers get access to in-depth commentary, analysis and surveys \u2014 which you know if you\u2019re already a subscriber. If you\u2019re not, consider signing up. Here are a few highlights from this week:\n\nInside the SBF trial: Rebecca and Jacquelyn report on the second day of the SBF and FTX trial. The prosecution painted Bankman-Fried as someone who knowingly committed fraud to achieve great wealth, power and influence, while the defense countered that the FTX founder acted in good faith, never meant to commit fraud or steal and basically got in over his head.\n\nBattery-boosting software tech: Tim covers Breathe Battery Technologies, a startup that\u2019s developed a bit of software that can be slipped into just about any lithium-ion battery in use today \u2014 endowing it with either faster charging speeds or greater longevity.\n\nWhat lies beyond ChatGPT: Anna surveyed 10 investors about the future of AI and what they believe might be the next big thing. Among other topics, they touched on where startups still stand a chance, where oligopoly dynamics and first-mover advantages are shaping up and the value of proprietary data.",

    "content": "Eddy Cue, in a dark suit, peered down at the monitor in front of him. The screens in the Washington, DC, courtroom had briefly malfunctioned and left witnesses with only binders, but now the tech was up and running \u2014 showing an image of three iPhones, each demonstrating a part of the phone\u2019s setup process. Cue squinted down at the screen.\n\n\u201cThe resolution on this is terrible,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should get a Mac.\u201d That got some laughs in an otherwise staid and quiet courtroom. Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the case, leaned into his microphone and responded, \u201cIf Apple would like to make a donation\u2026\u201d That got even bigger laughs. Then everybody got back down to business.\n\nCue was on the stand as a witness in US v. Google, the landmark antitrust trial over Google\u2019s search business. Cue is one of the highest-profile witnesses in the case so far, in part because the deal between Google and Apple \u2014 which makes Google the default search engine on all Apple devices and pays Apple billions of dollars a year \u2014 is central to the US Department of Justice\u2019s case against Google.\n\nCue had two messages: Apple believes in protecting its users\u2019 privacy, and it also believes in Google. Whether those two statements can be simultaneously true became the question of the day.\n\nApple is in court because of something called the Information Services Agreement, or ISA: a deal that makes Google\u2019s search engine the default on Apple\u2019s products. The ISA has been in place since 2002, but Cue was responsible for negotiating its current iteration with Google CEO Sundar Pichai in 2016. In testimony today, the Justice Department grilled Cue about the specifics of the deal.\n\nWhen the two sides renegotiated, Cue said on the stand, Apple wanted a higher percentage of the revenue Google made from Apple users it directed toward the search engine. Discussion of specific numbers was reserved for closed court sessions, but Cue wanted Apple to get a higher percentage, while Pichai wanted to keep the deal as it was. They eventually compromised on some other number we weren\u2019t told in court, and Google has been paying Apple that amount since.\n\n\u201cI always felt like it was in Google\u2019s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.\u201d\n\nMeagan Bellshaw, a Justice Department lawyer, asked Cue if he would have walked away from the deal if the two sides couldn\u2019t agree on a revenue-share figure. Cue said he\u2019d never really considered that an option: \u201cI always felt like it was in Google\u2019s best interest, and our best interest, to get a deal done.\u201d Cue also argued that the deal was about more than economics and that Apple never seriously considered switching to another provider or building its own search product. \u201cCertainly there wasn\u2019t a valid alternative to Google at the time,\u201d Cue said. He said there still isn\u2019t one.\n\nThat question \u2014 whether Apple picked Google because it\u2019s the most lucrative choice or the best product \u2014 was a key part of Cue\u2019s testimony and, in fact, a key part of the DOJ\u2019s entire case against Google. The Justice Department is focused on the deals Google makes \u2014 with Apple but also with Samsung and Mozilla and many others \u2014 to ensure it is the default search engine on practically every platform.\n\nBellshaw asked Cue a number of questions about the iPhone setup process. Those three screenshots showed the Appearance screen that shows up when you first boot up your iPhone so you can pick font sizes; the location-tracking prompt that appears when you open Maps; and the App Tracking Transparency pop-up that tells you when an app wants to collect your data. Cue objected to all these things being considered part of setup, but Bellshaw\u2019s point was that Apple offers its users a choice about lots of things, big and small, and that search could be one of them.\n\n\u201cWe try to get people up and running as fast as possible.\u201d\n\nCue acknowledged that the ISA didn\u2019t allow Apple to offer users a choice of search engines during setup but also said he wouldn\u2019t want to do that anyway. \u201cWe try to get people up and running as fast as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cSetup is just critical stuff.\u201d Showing people a bunch of search engines they\u2019ve never heard of would just be a bad user experience, he argued; even Cue couldn\u2019t remember the names of some of the alternatives to Google. \u201cWe make Google be the default search engine,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we\u2019ve always thought it was the best. We pick the best one and let users easily change it.\u201d (\u201cEasily\u201d is a persistent point of contention in this trial \u2014 DuckDuckGo\u2019s CEO, who testified last week, claimed it takes \u201ctoo many steps\u201d to switch.)\n\nAs for the privacy pop-ups? This is where Bellshaw began to press on how exactly Apple decided Google had the best product. She asked Cue if Apple believes user privacy is important, to which he said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Then, she showed a series of emails and slides in which Cue and Apple railed against Google\u2019s privacy policies. Cue readily agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve always thought we had better privacy than Google,\u201d he told Bellshaw. He said that one provision of the ISA with Google was that Google had to allow people to search without logging in and that Apple has done things in Safari and around its platforms to make it harder for Google or anyone else to track users.\n\nBellshaw never quite said it, but the DOJ\u2019s implication seemed to be that, essentially, Google is a privacy menace anathema to everything Apple believes is important to its users, but Apple gives it a central place in its platform because Google pays it so handsomely. Bellshaw asked Cue to review some of Apple\u2019s financial filings. Isn\u2019t it true that the ISA represents a significant portion of Apple\u2019s profits, she asked? Cue said that\u2019s not how Apple looks at it because it doesn\u2019t account for all the work Apple did to make its platform so appealing that an agreement like this could work as well as it does.\n\nLater, after a closed session in the courtroom and a break for lunch, Google lawyer John Schmidtlein led Cue through a history of the Google / Apple partnership, and a history of the Safari browser. Cue noted that Safari\u2019s combination of URL and search bar was a user interface innovation, and the seamless Google integration was part of what made it work. In early promotional materials for Safari, Schmidtlein pointed out, the Google integration was nearly always mentioned.\n\n\u201cBefore 2003,\u201d Cue said, \u201cthe way that you searched the web was you had to go in and you had to type in google.com in the URL field, or you could type in another URL. We came up with the idea that if you type anything in the URL field that\u2019s not a URL, it just goes to search.\u201d\n\nSchmidtlein\u2019s overall point was that Google helped Safari succeed not by forcing Apple\u2019s hand, but by being a great product that integrated seamlessly with Apple\u2019s own stuff. He referenced Apple\u2019s deals with Yahoo and Bing that make those services easy to find, and both men argued that switching search engines is so easy as to be a non-issue. Bellshaw briefly stepped up to rebut that notion, and that was it for Cue\u2019s testimony.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s all the testimony we saw. Like so many things in this trial, the star witness was kept mostly under wraps thanks to complaints and worries about revealing confidential numbers and corporate secrets. But the questions put to Cue were the same ones the DOJ is going to keep asking: is Google really the best search engine, or is it just the one writing the biggest checks? And if those checks went away, what would the search engine market look like? Cue said Apple\u2019s never really thought about it. Google said Apple would be silly to do so. And the Justice Department thinks it\u2019s about time Apple starts doing so.",

    "content": "Who is Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX? Is he a liar and a fraud? Or did he act in good faith, and like many a startup founder, fly too close to the sun?\n\nThat answer ultimately lies with the jury, which was selected on Wednesday morning before lawyers for the government and then Bankman-Fried swapped two very different stories of the former crypto mogul\u2019s sudden rise and almost instantaneous fall.\n\nHere\u2019s what happened on the second day of the trial, which featured pointed allegations, a friend from MIT, and an audience replete with big names, including Bankman-Fried\u2019s professorial parents and Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\n\nA conscious criminal\u2026\n\nThe prosecution\u2019s account of the alleged crimes by Bankman-Fried, who spent most of his day in court staring into a laptop while seated between his two attorneys, featured a study in contrasts.\n\n\u201cOne year ago, it looked like the defendant was on the top of the world,\u201d began Thane Rehn, a prosecutor for the government, in his opening statement. The former CEO of FTX oversaw a supposedly thriving crypto exchange, jetted between international locales, and hobnobbed with celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David. He repeatedly emphasized to customers that their money was safe and secure.\n\nBut \u201call of that, all of it, was built on lies,\u201d Rehn declared to the jury. \u201cBehind the curtains, he was not what he appeared to be.\u201d What followed was a roughly 30-minute story that repeatedly emphasized how Bankman-Fried allegedly stole customer funds to facilitate his jet-setting lifestyle, donate millions to political candidates, and finance risky bets.\n\nThe key to his alleged scheme? Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also owned, argued Rehn. Using Caroline Ellison, his on-again off-again girlfriend and the CEO of Alameda, as a front, Bankman-Fried had \u201csecret access\u201d to customer money\u2014both cash and crypto\u2014the government claimed.\n\nMoreover, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed employees to conceal the flow of money into FTX\u2019s coffers and forged financial documents distributed to lenders and investors. \u201cThe defendant lied to the world,\u201d Rehn alleged.\n\nAnd who was this defendant? Not a crypto \u201cboy\u201d genius, as so many in the media (Fortune included) have written, but a \u201cman\u201d who \u201cstole billions of dollars from thousands of victims,\u201d Rehn said. \u201cYou will see the full picture.\u201d\n\n\u2026or a well-meaning founder?\n\nBut Bankman-Fried, whose cheekbones were more prominent after spending about seven weeks in a Brooklyn prison, was no liar, according to Mark Cohen, one of his lawyers. \u201cSam didn\u2019t defraud anyone,\u201d he said early on in his opening statement.\n\nWhat the jury will see is a nerdy startup founder who acted in \u201cgood faith,\u201d not the prosecution\u2019s \u201ccartoon of a villain.\u201d (Cohen repeatedly harped on Bankman-Fried\u2019s allegedly good-faith actions throughout his address to the jury.)\n\nAlameda was not subterranean or shady. It was a successful hedge fund, he said. FTX was no Ponzi scheme. It was a \u201cvery innovative, successful company.\u201d And the business practices between the two were reasonable, he argued, claiming that Alameda acted legally as an FTX customer, payment processor, and market maker, or financial entity that acts as a trading partner for customers looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.\n\nIn an analogy he employed throughout his opening statement, he said that \u201cworking at a startup is like building a plane as you\u2019re flying it\u201d and that businesses sometimes fail. In fact, he specifically pointed the finger at Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, who, he said, did not adequately protect her hedge fund from the inherent risk of the crypto markets.\n\nWhen the walls came closing in and the aforementioned plane approached the \u201ceye of the storm,\u201d Bankman-Fried did not act like someone who was guilty. Rather, he was willing to give up his personal wealth to make customers whole, Cohen argued.\n\n\u201cIn the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,\u201d he concluded. \u201cHe didn\u2019t steal any money.\u201d\n\nA Frenchman who lives in London testifies in New York\n\nAfter lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand\u2014and they weren\u2019t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison.\n\nThe first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.\n\nOn Nov. 8, in the crypto exchange\u2019s final few days, he tried to pull out his cash and crypto. How much? Almost $100,000, he said. And was he ever able to? \u201cNever,\u201d he told prosecutors.\n\nShortly afterward, as the trial neared late afternoon, the government called Adam Yedidia to the stand. A fast-talking graduate of MIT, he and Bankman-Fried were close friends in college, he said. And after Bankman-Fried left Jane Street, the high-frequency trading firm where the former billionaire got his start in finance after MIT, he persuaded Yedidia to join him as a trader at Alameda and then as a developer at FTX.\n\nWhen Yedidia first took the stand, Danielle Sassoon, one of the lead prosecutors, said that the college friend of Bankman-Fried had legal immunity during his testimony. Why did he make such a deal with the government, she asked.\n\n\u201cI was concerned that I had unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime,\u201d he said.\n\nSoon, however, the clock neared 4:30 p.m., and court adjourned for the day. Yedidia will continue his testimony on Thursday, followed by Matt Huang, a former partner at the high-powered venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and then Gary Wang, a key Bankman-Fried lieutenant and one of the government\u2019s star witnesses.",

    "content": "A new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers. The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cGoogle compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers\u2019 websites \u2014 what Google calls \u2018materials shared across the web\u2019 \u2014and from \u2018open source and licensed databases,'\u201d it says.\n\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nSome publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\n\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content. Publishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\n\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\n\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals. It also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n\n\u201cThe anticompetitive effects of Google\u2019s scheme cause profound harm to competition, to consumers, to labor, and to a democratic free press,\u201d reads an announcement posted to the website of the law firm handling the case, Hausfeld.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff Helena World Chronicle, LLC invokes the Sherman Act and Clayton Act to seek class-wide monetary and injunctive relief to restore and ensure competition for digital news and reference publishing and set up guardrails to preserve a free marketplace of ideas in the new era of artificial intelligence,\u201d it states.\n\nA Google spokesperson offered a statement on the lawsuit, saying \u201cThis lawsuit is meritless. People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n\nHelena World Chronicle, LLC v. Google LLC and Alphabet Inc by TechCrunch on Scribd\n\nEditor\u2019s note: This post was updated after publication with a statement provided by Google on Friday evening.",

    "content": "ChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s viral AI chatbot, turns one today.\n\nA year ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d \u2014 reportedly spurred in part by an intense rivalry with AI startup Anthropic. The goal, OpenAI leadership told the OpenAI rank-and-file at the time, was to gather more data on how people use and interact with generative AI to inform the development of OpenAI\u2019s future models.\n\nInitially a basic free-to-use, web-based and chat-focused interface on top of one of OpenAI\u2019s existing models, GPT-3.5, ChatGPT would go on to become the company\u2019s most popular product\u2026 ever \u2014 and the fastest-growing consumer app in history.\n\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nIn the months following its launch, ChatGPT gained paid tiers with additional features, including a plan geared toward enterprise customers. OpenAI also upgraded ChatGPT with web searching, document analyzing and image creating (via DALL-E 3) capabilities. And, leaning on speech recognition, voice synthesis and text-image understanding models developed in house, OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to \u201chear,\u201d \u201cspeak,\u201d \u201csee\u201d and take actions.\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT became priority number one at OpenAI \u2014 not simply a one-off product but a development platform to build upon. And, as often happens in a competition-driven marketplace, it shifted the focus at other AI firms and research labs, too.\n\nGoogle scrambled to launch a response to ChatGPT, eventually releasing Bard, a more or less comparable AI chatbot, in February. Countless other ChatGPT rivals and derivatives have arrived to market since, most recently Amazon Q, a more business-oriented take on ChatGPT. DeepMind, Google\u2019s premier AI research lab, is expected to debut a next-gen chatbot, Gemini, before the end of the year.\n\nStella Biderman, an AI researcher at Booz Allen Hamilton and the open research group EleutherAI, told me that she doesn\u2019t see ChatGPT as an AI breakthrough per se. (OpenAI, which has released dozens of research papers on its models, tellingly never released one on ChatGPT.) But, she says, ChatGPT was a bonafide \u201cuser experience breakthrough\u201d \u2014 taking generative AI mainstream.\n\n\u201cThe primary impact [ChatGPT] has had [is] encouraging people training AIs to try to mimic it, or encouraging people studying AIs to use it as their central object of study,\u201d Biderman said. \u201cPreviously you needed to have some skill, albeit not be an expert, to consistently get usable stuff out of [text-generating models]. Now that that\u2019s changed \u2026 [ChatGPT has] brought a very large amount of attention to and discussion about the technology.\u201d\n\nAnd ChatGPT still gets a lot of attention \u2014 at least if third-party statistics are anything to go by.\n\nAccording to Similarweb, the web metrics company, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT web portal saw 140.7 million unique visitors in October while the ChatGPT iOS and Android apps have 4.9 million monthly active users in the U.S. alone. Data from analytics firm Data.ai suggests that the apps have generated nearly $30 million in subscription revenue \u2014 a hefty amount considering that they launched just a few months ago.\n\nOne of the reasons for ChatGPT\u2019s enduring popularity is its ability to conduct conversations that are \u201cconvincingly real,\u201d according to Ruoxi Shang, a third-year PhD student at the University of Washington studying human-AI interaction. Prior to ChatGPT, people were already familiar with chatbots \u2014 they\u2019ve existed for decades after all. But the models powering ChatGPT are much more sophisticated than what many users were accustomed to.\n\n\u201cHuman-computer interaction researchers have studied how conversational interfaces can improve understandability of information, and the socialization aspects of chatbots bring increased engagement,\u201d Shang said. \u201cNow, AI models have enabled conversational agents to conduct conversations nearly indistinguishable from human dialogues.\u201d\n\nAdam Hyland, also a PhD student studying AI at the University of Washington, points out the emotional component: conversations with ChatGPT have a palpably different \u201cfeel\u201d than with more rudimentary chatbots.\n\n\u201cIn the 1960s, ELIZA offered a chatbot, the response to which was very similar to how people reacted to ChatGPT,\u201d Hyland said, referring to the chatbot created by MIT computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. \u201cHumans interacting with the system inferred emotional content and a narrative through line in chat messages.\u201d\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT has impressed cynics like The New York Times\u2019 Kevin Roose, who called it the \u201cthe best AI chatbot ever released to the general public.\u201d In The Atlantic magazine\u2019s \u201cBreakthroughs of the Year\u201d for 2022, Derek Thompson included ChatGPT as part of \u201cthe generative-AI eruption\u201d that \u201cmay change our mind about how we work, how we think and what human creativity is.\u201d\n\nChatGPT\u2019s skills extend beyond conversation, of course \u2014 another likely reason for its staying power. ChatGPT can complete and debug code, compose music and essays, answer test questions, generate business ideas, write poetry and song lyrics, translate and summarize text and even emulate a computer running Linux.\n\nAn MIT study showed that, for tasks like writing cover letters, \u201cdelicate\u201d emails and cost-benefit analyses, ChatGPT decreased the amount of time it took workers to complete the tasks by 40% while increasing output quality by 18%, as measured by third-party evaluators.\n\n\u201cBecause [the AI models powering OpenAI] have been trained extensively on vast amounts of data,\u201d Shang added, \u201cthey [have] shifted focus from training specialized chatbots for specific domains to creating more general-purpose systems that can handle a variety of topics easily through prompting with instructions \u2026 [Chatbots like ChatGPT] don\u2019t require users to learn any new form of language, as long as they provide a task and some desired output just like how a manager would communicate to an intern.\u201d\n\nNow, there\u2019s mixed evidence as to whether ChatGPT is actually being used in these ways. A Pew Research survey from August showed that only 18% of Americans have ever tried ChatGPT, and that most who\u2019ve tried it use the chatbot for entertainment purposes or answering one-off questions. Teens might not be using ChatGPT all that often, either (despite what some alarmist headlines imply), with one poll finding that only two in five teenagers have used the tech in the last six months.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s limitations might be to blame.\n\nWhile undeniably capable, ChatGPT is far from perfect, owing to the way it was developed and \u201ctaught.\u201d Trained to predict the likeliest next word \u2014 or likeliest next parts of words \u2014 by observing billions of examples of text from around the web, ChatGPT sometimes \u201challucinates,\u201d or writes answers that sound plausible but aren\u2019t factually correct. (ChatGPT\u2019s hallucinating tendencies got its answers banned from the Q&A site Stack Overflow and from at least one academic conference \u2014 and accused of defamation.) ChatGPT can also show bias in its responses, answering in sexist and racist, overtly Anglocentric ways \u2014 or regurgitating portions of the data that it was trained on.\n\nLawyers have been sanctioned after using ChatGPT to assist in writing motions, discovering \u2014 too late \u2014 that ChatGPT invented fake lawsuit citations. And scores of authors have sued OpenAI over the chatbot regurgitating portions of their work \u2014 and not receiving compensation for it.\n\nSo what comes next? What might ChatGPT\u2019s second year hold, if not more of the same?\n\nInterestingly \u2014 and fortunately \u2014 some of the more dire predictions about ChatGPT didn\u2019t come to pass. Some researchers feared the chatbot would be used to generate disinformation on a massive scale, while others sounded the alarm over ChatGPT\u2019s phishing email-, spam- and malware-generating potential.\n\nThe concerns pushed policymakers in Europe to mandate security assessments for any products using generative AI systems like ChatGPT, and over 20,000 signatories \u2014 including Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak \u2014 to sign an open letter calling for the immediate pause of large-scale AI experiments like ChatGPT.\n\nBut examples of ChatGPT abuse in the wild have been few and far between \u2014 so far.\n\nWith the launch of GPTs, OpenAI\u2019s tool for building custom conversational, action-taking AI systems powered by OpenAI\u2019s models, including the models underpinning ChatGPT, ChatGPT could become more a gateway to a broader ecosystem of AI-powered chatbots than the end-all-be-all.\n\nWith GPTs, a user can train a model on a cookbook collection, for example, so that it can answer questions about ingredients for a specific recipe. Or they can give a model their company\u2019s proprietary codebases so that developers can check their style or generate code in line with best practices.\n\nSome of the initial GPTs \u2014 all created by OpenAI \u2014 include a Gen Z meme translator, a coloring book and sticker creator, a data visualizer, a board game explainer and a creative writing coach. Now, ChatGPT can accomplish these tasks given carefully engineered prompts and foreknowledge. But purpose-built GPTs drastically simplify things \u2014 and might just kill the cottage industry that emerged around creating and editing prompts to feed to ChatGPT.\n\nGPTs introduce a level of personalization far beyond that ChatGPT offers today, and \u2014 once OpenAI sorts out its capacity issues \u2014 I expect we\u2019ll see an explosion of creativity there. Will ChatGPT be as visible as it once was after GPTs flood the marketplace? Perhaps not. But it won\u2019t go away \u2014 it\u2019ll simply adapt and evolve, no doubt in ways not even its creators can anticipate.",

    "content": "ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\n\nChatGPT, OpenAI\u2019s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. What started as a tool to hyper-charge productivity through writing essays and code with short text prompts has evolved into a behemoth used by more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies for more wide-ranging needs. And that growth has propelled OpenAI itself into becoming one of the most-hyped companies in recent memory, even if CEO and co-founder Sam Altman\u2019s firing and swift return raised concerns about its direction and opened the door for competitors.\n\nWhat does that mean for OpenAI, ChatGPT and its other ambitions? The fallout is still settling, but it might empower competitors like Meta and its LLaMA family of large language models, or help other AI startups get attention and funding as the industry watches OpenAI implode and put itself back together.\n\nWhile there is a more\u2026nefarious side to ChatGPT, it\u2019s clear that AI tools are not going away anytime soon. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.\n\nPrior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.\n\nGPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers. Beyond GPT-4 and OpenAI DevDay announcements, OpenAI recently connected ChatGPT to the internet for all users. And with the integration of DALL-E 3, users are also able to generate both text prompts and images right in ChatGPT.\n\nHere\u2019s a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we\u2019ve been updating throughout the year. And if you have any other questions, check out our ChatGPT FAQ here.\n\nTimeline of the most recent ChatGPT updates\n\nDecember 2023\n\nOpenAI re-opens ChatGPT Plus subscriptions\n\nAfter pausing ChatGPT Plus subscriptions in November due to a \u201csurge of usage,\u201d OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced they have once again enabled sign-ups. The Plus subscription includes access to GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo.\n\nwe have re-enabled chatgpt plus subscriptions! \ud83c\udf84 thanks for your patience while we found more gpus. \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) December 13, 2023\n\nOpenAI and Axel Springer partner up for a \u201creal-time\u201d ChatGPT news deal\n\nOpenAI has struck a new deal with Berlin-based news publisher Axel Springer, which owns Business Insider and Politico, to \u201chelp provide people with new ways to access quality, real-time news content through our AI tools.\u201d OpenAI will train its generative AI models on the publisher\u2019s content and add recent Axel Springer-published articles to ChatGPT.\n\nStanford researchers say ChatGPT didn\u2019t cause an influx in cheating in high schools\n\nNew research from Stanford University shows that the popularization of chatbots like ChatGPT have not caused an increase in cheating across U.S. high schools. In a survey of more than 40 U.S. high schools, researchers found that cheating rates are similar across the board this year.\n\nChatGPT users worry the chatbot is experiencing seasonal depression\n\nStarting in November, ChatGPT users have noticed that the chatbot feels \u201clazier\u201d than normal, citing instances of simpler answers and refusing to complete requested tasks. OpenAI has confirmed that they are aware of this issue, but aren\u2019t sure why it\u2019s happening.\n\nSome users think it plays into the \u201cwinter break hypothesis,\u201d which argues that AI is worse in December because it \u201clearned\u201d to do less work over the holidays, while others wonder if the chatbot is simulating seasonal depression.\n\nwe've heard all your feedback about GPT4 getting lazier! we haven't updated the model since Nov 11th, and this certainly isn't intentional. model behavior can be unpredictable, and we're looking into fixing it \ud83e\udee1 \u2014 ChatGPT (@ChatGPTapp) December 8, 2023\n\nJudges in the U.K. are now allowed to use ChatGPT in legal rulings\n\nThe U.K. Judicial Office issued guidance that permits judges to use ChatGPT, along with other AI tools, to write legal rulings and perform court duties. The guidance lays out ways to responsibly use AI in the courts, including being aware of potential bias and upholding privacy.\n\nOpenAI makes repeating words \u201cforever\u201d a violation of its terms of service after Google DeepMind test\n\nFollowing an experiment by Google DeepMind researchers that led ChatGPT to repeat portions of its training data, OpenAI has flagged asking ChatGPT to repeat specific words \u201cforever\u201d as a violation of its terms of service.\n\nLawmakers in Brazil enact an ordinance written by ChatGPT\n\nCity lawmakers in Brazil enacted a piece of legislation written entirely by ChatGPT without even knowing. Weeks after the bill was passed, Porto Alegre councilman Ramiro Ros\u00e1rio admitted that he used ChatGPT to write the proposal, and did not tell fellow council members until after the fact.\n\nOpenAI reportedly delays the launch of its GPT store to 2024\n\nAccording to a memo seen by Axios, OpenAI plans to delay the launch of its highly anticipated GPT store to early 2024. Custom GPTs and the accompanying store was a major announcement at OpenAI\u2019s DevDay conference, with the store expected to open last month.\n\nNovember 2023\n\nChatGPTs mobile apps top 110M installs and nearly $30M in revenue\n\nAfter launching for iOS and Androidin May and July, ChatGPT\u2019s have topped 110 million combined installs and have reached nearly $30 million in consumer spending, according to a market analysis by data.ai.\n\nChatGPT celebrates one-year anniversary\n\nOpenAI hit a major milestone: one year of ChatGPT. What began as a \u201clow-key research preview\u201d evolved into a powerhouse that changed the AI industry forever. In a post on X, CEO Sam Altman looked back on the night before its launch: \u201cwhat a year it\u2019s been\u2026\u201d\n\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nApple and Google avoid naming ChatGPT as their \u2018app of the year\u2019\n\nNeither Apple nor Google chose an AI app as its app of the year for 2023, despite the success of ChatGPT\u2019s mobile app, which became the fastest-growing consumer application in history before the record was broken by Meta\u2019s Threads.\n\nAn attack from researchers prompts ChatGPT to reveal training data\n\nA test led by researchers at Google DeepMind found that there is a significant amount of privately identifiable information in OpenAI\u2019s LLMs. The test involved asking ChatGPT to repeat the word \u201cpoem\u201d forever, among other words, which over time led the chatbot to churn out private information like email addresses and phone numbers.\n\nChatGPT and other AI chatbots are fueling an increase in phishing emails\n\nAccording to a new report by SlashNext, there\u2019s been a 1,265% increase in malicious phishing emails since Q4 of 2022. The report alleges that AI tools like ChatGPT are being prominently used by cybercriminals to write compelling and sophisticated phishing emails.\n\nSouth Africa officials investigate if President Cyril Ramaphosa used ChatGPT to write a speech\n\nFollowing speculation, social media users fed portions of Ramaphosa\u2019s November 21 speech in Johannesburg through AI detectors, alleging parts of it may have been written with ChatGPT. South African presidency spokesperson Vincent Magwenya refuted the claims, and local officials are investigating.\n\nChatGPT Voice can be used to replace Siri\n\nNow that OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT Voice feature is available to all free users, it can be used to replace Siri on an iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max by configuring the new Action Button. The new feature lets you ask ChatGPT questions and listen to its responses \u2014 like a much smarter version of Siri.\n\nSam Altman returns as CEO\n\nAltman\u2019s return came swiftly, with an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d announced between him and OpenAI\u2019s board that will reinstate him as CEO and restructure the board to include new members, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. The biggest takeaway for ChatGPT is that the members of the board more focused on the nonprofit side of OpenAI, with the most concerns over the commercialization of its tools, have been pushed to the side.\n\nChatGPT Voice rolls out to all free users\n\nEven if its leadership is in flux, OpenAI is still releasing updates to ChatGPT. First announced in September and granted to paid users on a rolling basis, the text-to-speech model can create a voice from text prompts and a few seconds of speech samples. OpenAI worked with voice actors to create the five voice options, and you can give it a shot by heading to the settings in your mobile ChatGPT apps and tapping the \u201cheadphones\u201d icon.\n\nSam Altman might return, but it\u2019s complicated\n\nThe only constant within OpenAI right now is change, and in a series of interviews, Nadella hedged on earlier reporting that Altman and Brockman were headed to Microsoft.\n\n\u201cObviously, we want Sam and Greg to have a fantastic home if they\u2019re not going to be in OpenAI,\u201d Nadella said in an interview with CNBC, saying that we was \u201copen\u201d to them settling at Microsoft or returning to OpenAI should the board and employees support the move.\n\nConfirmation Sam Altman will not return as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\n\nA number of investors and OpenAI employees tried to bring back Altman after his sudden firing by the company\u2019s board, but following a weekend of negotiations, it was confirmed that Altman would not return to OpenAI and new leadership would take hold. What this means for ChatGPT\u2019s future, and for the OpenAI Dev Day announcements, remains to be seen.\n\nSam Altman ousted as OpenAI\u2019s CEO\n\nSam Altman has been fired from OpenAI. He will leave the company\u2019s board and step down as CEO, with OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer Mira Murati stepping in as interim CEO. In a blog post from OpenAI, the company writes that the board \u201cno longer has confidence in [Altman\u2019s] ability to continue leading OpenAI.\u201d\n\nIn a statement on X, Altman said working at OpenAI \u201cwas transformative\u201d for him and \u201chopefully the world.\u201d\n\nOpenAI explores how ChatGPT can be used in the classroom\n\nOpenAI COO Brad Lightcap revealed at a San Francisco conference that the company will likely create a team to identify ways AI and ChatGPT can be used in education. This announcement comes at a time when ChatGPT is being criticized by educators for encouraging cheating, resulting in bans in certain school districts.\n\nOpenAI pauses new ChatGPT Plus subscriptions due to a \u201csurge of usage\u201d\n\nFollowing OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day conference, Sam Altman announced the company is putting a pause on new subscriptions for its premium ChatGPT Plus offering. The temporary hold on sign-ups, as well as the demand for ChatGPT Plus\u2019 new features like making custom GPTS, has led to a slew of resellers on eBay.\n\nChatGPT gets flagged as potentially unsafe for kids\n\nAn independent review from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit advocacy group, found that ChatGPT could potentially be harmful for younger users. ChatGPT got an overall three-star rating in the report, with its lowest ratings relating to transparency, privacy, trust and safety.\n\nOpenAI blames DDoS attack for ChatGPT outage\n\nOpenAI confirmed that a DDoS attack was behind outages affecting ChatGPT and its developer tools. ChatGPT experienced sporadic outages for about 24 hours, resulting in users being unable to log into or use the service.\n\nOpenAI debuts GPT-4 Turbo\n\nOpenAI unveiled GPT-4 Turbo at its first-ever OpenAI DevDay conference. GPT-4 Turbo comes in two versions: one that\u2019s strictly text-analyzing and another that understands the context of both text and images.\n\nGPT-4 gets a fine-tuning\n\nAs opposed to the fine-tuning program for GPT-3.5, the GPT-4 program will involve more oversight and guidance from OpenAI teams, the company says \u2014 largely due to technical hurdles.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s GPT Store lets you build (and monetize) your own GPT\n\nUsers and developers will soon be able to make their own GPT, with no coding experience required. Anyone building their own GPT will also be able to list it on OpenAI\u2019s marketplace and monetize it in the future.\n\nChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users\n\nAfter being released nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also revealed that over two million developers use the platform, including more than 92% of Fortune 500 companies.\n\nOpenAI launches DALL-E 3 API, new text-to-speech models\n\nDALL-E 3, OpenAI\u2019s text-to-image model, is now available via an API after first coming to ChatGPT-4 and Bing Chat. OpenAI\u2019s newly released text-to-speech API, Audio API, offers six preset voices to choose from and two generative AI model variants.\n\nOpenAI promises to defend business customers against copyright claims\n\nBowing to peer pressure, OpenAI it will pay legal costs incurred by customers who face lawsuits over IP claims against work generated by an OpenAI tool. The protections seemingly don\u2019t extend to all OpenAI products, like the free and Plus tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nAs OpenAI\u2019s multimodal API launches broadly, research shows it\u2019s still flawed\n\nOpenAI announced that GPT-4 with vision will become available alongside the upcoming launch of GPT-4 Turbo API. But some researchers found that the model remains flawed in several significant and problematic ways.\n\nOpenAI launches API, letting developers build \u2018assistants\u2019 into their apps\n\nAt its OpenAI DevDay, OpenAI announced the Assistants API to help developers build \u201cagent-like experiences\u201d within their apps. Use cases range from a natural language-based data analysis app to a coding assistant or even an AI-powered vacation planner.\n\nOctober 2023\n\nChatGPT app revenue shows no signs of slowing, but it\u2019s not #1\n\nOpenAI\u2019s chatbot app far outpaces all others on mobile devices in terms of downloads, but it\u2019s surprisingly not the top AI app by revenue. Several other AI chatbots, like \u201cChat & Ask AI\u201d and \u201cChatOn \u2014 AI Chat Bot Assistant\u201d, are actually making more money than ChatGPT.\n\nChatGPT tests the ability to upload and analyze files for Plus users\n\nSubscribers to ChatGPT\u2019s Enterprise Plan have reported new beta features, including the ability to upload PDFs to analyze and and ask questions about them directly. The new rollout also makes it so users no longer have to manually select a mode like DALL-E and browsing when using ChatGPT. Instead, users will automatically be switched to models based on the prompt.\n\nChatGPT officially gets web search\n\nOpenAI has formally launched its internet-browsing feature to ChatGPT, some three weeks after re-introducing the feature in beta after several months in hiatus. The AI chatbot that has historically been limited to data up to September, 2021.\n\nOpenAI integrates DALL-E 3 into ChatGPT\n\nThe integration means users don\u2019t have to think so carefully about their text-prompts when asking DALL-E to create an image. Users will also now be able to receive images as part of their text-based queries without having to switch between apps.\n\nMicrosoft-affiliated research finds flaws in GPT-4\n\nA Microsoft-affiliated scientific paper looked at the \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d \u2014 and toxicity \u2014 of LLMs, including GPT-4. Because GPT-4 is more likely to follow the instructions of \u201cjailbreaking\u201d prompts, the co-authors claim that GPT-4 can be more easily prompted than other LLMs to spout toxic, biased text.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s mobile app hits record $4.58M in revenue in September\n\nOpenAI amassed 15.6 million downloads and nearly $4.6 million in gross revenue across its iOS and Android apps worldwide in September. But revenue growth has now begun to slow, according to new data from market intelligence firm Appfigures \u2014 dropping from 30% to 20% in September.\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet (again)\n\nOpenAI posted on Twitter/X that ChatGPT can now browse the internet and is no longer limited to data before September 2021. The chatbot had a web browsing capability for Plus subscribers back in July, but the feature was taken away after users exploited it to get around paywalls.\n\nChatGPT can now browse the internet to provide you with current and authoritative information, complete with direct links to sources. It is no longer limited to data before September 2021. pic.twitter.com/pyj8a9HWkB \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) September 27, 2023\n\nChatGPT now has a voice\n\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s adding a new voice for verbal conversations and image-based smarts to the AI-powered chatbot.\n\nPoland opens an investigation against OpenAI\n\nThe Polish authority publically announced it has opened an investigation regarding ChatGPT \u2014 accusing the company of a string of breaches of the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nOpenAI unveils DALL-E 3\n\nThe upgraded text-to-image tool, DALL-E 3, uses ChatGPT to help fill in prompts. Subscribers to OpenAI\u2019s premium ChatGPT plans, ChatGPT Plus and ChatGPT Enterprise, can type in a request for an image and hone it through conversations with the chatbot \u2014 receiving the results directly within the chat app.\n\nOpera GX integrates ChatGPT-powered AI\n\nPowered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, the AI browser Aria launched on Opera in May to give users an easier way to search, ask questions and write code. Today, the company announced it is bringing Aria to Opera GX, a version of the flagship Opera browser that is built for gamers.\n\nThe new feature allows Opera GX users to interact directly with a browser AI to find the latest gaming news and tips.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nOpenAI releases a guide for teachers using ChatGPT in the classroom\n\nOpenAI wants to rehabilitate the system\u2019s image a bit when it comes to education, as ChatGPT has been controversial in the classroom due to plagiarism. OpenAI has offered up a selection of ways to put the chatbot to work in the classroom.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Enterprise\n\nChatGPT Enterprise can perform the same tasks as ChatGPT, such as writing emails, drafting essays and debugging computer code. However, the new offering also adds \u201centerprise-grade\u201d privacy and data analysis capabilities on top of the vanilla ChatGPT, as well as enhanced performance and customization options.\n\nSurvey finds relatively few American use ChatGPT\n\nRecent Pew polling suggests the language model isn\u2019t quite as popular or threatening as some would have you think. Ongoing polling by Pew Research shows that although ChatGPT is gaining mindshare, only about 18% of Americans have ever actually used it.\n\nOpenAI brings fine-tuning to GPT-3.5 Turbo\n\nWith fine-tuning, companies using GPT-3.5 Turbo through the company\u2019s API can make the model better follow specific instructions. For example, having the model always respond in a given language. Or improving the model\u2019s ability to consistently format responses, as well as hone the \u201cfeel\u201d of the model\u2019s output, like its tone, so that it better fits a brand or voice. Most notably, fine-tuning enables OpenAI customers to shorten text prompts to speed up API calls and cut costs.\n\nOpenAI is partnering with Scale AI to allow companies to fine-tune GPT-3.5. However, it is unclear whether OpenAI is developing an in-house tuning tool that is meant to complement platforms like Scale AI or serve a different purpose altogether.\n\nFine-tuning costs:\n\nTraining: $0.008 / 1K tokens\n\nUsage input: $0.012 / 1K tokens\n\nUsage output: $0.016 / 1K tokens\n\nOpenAI acquires Global Illumination\n\nIn OpenAI\u2019s first public acquisition in its seven-year history, the company announced it has acquired Global Illumination, a New York-based startup leveraging AI to build creative tools, infrastructure and digital experiences.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited for the impact they\u2019ll have here at OpenAI,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a brief post published to its official blog. \u201cThe entire team has joined OpenAI to work on our core products including ChatGPT.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018custom instructions\u2019 feature is extended to free ChatGPT users\n\nOpenAI announced that it\u2019s expanding custom instructions to all users, including those on the free tier of service. The feature allows users to add various preferences and requirements that they want the AI chatbot to consider when responding.\n\nChina requires AI apps to obtain an administrative license\n\nMultiple generative AI apps have been removed from Apple\u2019s China App Store ahead of the country\u2019s latest generative AI regulations that are set to take effect August 15.\n\n\u201cAs you may know, the government has been tightening regulations associated with deep synthesis technologies (DST) and generative AI services, including ChatGPT. DST must fulfill permitting requirements to operate in China, including securing a license from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT),\u201d Apple said in a letter to OpenCat, a native ChatGPT client. \u201cBased on our review, your app is associated with ChatGPT, which does not have requisite permits to operate in China.\u201d\n\nJuly 2023\n\nChatGPT for Android is now available in the US, India, Bangladesh and Brazil\n\nA few days after putting up a preorder page on Google Play, OpenAI has flipped the switch and released ChatGPT for Android. The app is now live in a handful of countries.\n\nChatGPT is coming to Android\n\nChatGPT is available to \u201cpre-order\u201d for Android users.\n\nThe ChatGPT app on Android looks to be more or less identical to the iOS one in functionality, meaning it gets most if not all of the web-based version\u2019s features. You should be able to sync your conversations and preferences across devices, too \u2014 so if you\u2019re iPhone at home and Android at work, no worries.\n\nOpenAI launches customized instructions for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI launched custom instructions for ChatGPT users, so they don\u2019t have to write the same instruction prompts to the chatbot every time they interact with it.\n\nThe company said this feature lets you \u201cshare anything you\u2019d like ChatGPT to consider in its response.\u201d For example, a teacher can say they are teaching fourth-grade math or a developer can specify the code language they prefer when asking for suggestions. A person can also specify their family size, so the text-generating AI can give responses about meals, grocery and vacation planning accordingly.\n\nThe FTC is reportedly investigating OpenAI\n\nThe FTC is reportedly in at least the exploratory phase of investigation over whether OpenAI\u2019s flagship ChatGPT conversational AI made \u201cfalse, misleading, disparaging or harmful\u201d statements about people.\n\nTechCrunch Reporter Devin Coldewey reports:\n\nThis kind of investigation doesn\u2019t just appear out of thin air \u2014 the FTC doesn\u2019t look around and say \u201cThat looks suspicious.\u201d Generally a lawsuit or formal complaint is brought to their attention and the practices described by it imply that regulations are being ignored. For example, a person may sue a supplement company because the pills made them sick, and the FTC will launch an investigation on the back of that because there\u2019s evidence the company lied about the side effects.\n\nOpenAI announced the general availability of GPT-4\n\nStarting July 6, all existing OpenAI developers \u201cwith a history of successful payments\u201d can access GPT-4. OpenAI plans to open up access to new developers by the end of July.\n\nIn the future, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll allow developers to fine-tune GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, one of the original models powering ChatGPT, with their own data, as has long been possible with several of OpenAI\u2019s other text-generating models. That capability should arrive later this year, according to OpenAI.\n\nJune 2023\n\nChatGPT app can now search the web only on Bing\n\nOpenAI announced that subscribers to ChatGPT Plus can now use a new feature on the app called Browsing, which allows ChatGPT to search Bing for answers to questions.\n\nThe Browsing feature can be enabled by heading to the New Features section of the app settings, selecting \u201cGPT-4\u201d in the model switcher and choosing \u201cBrowse with Bing\u201d from the drop-down list. Browsing is available on both the iOS and Android ChatGPT apps.\n\nMercedes is adding ChatGPT to its infotainment system\n\nU.S. owners of Mercedes models that use MBUX will be able to opt into a beta program starting June 16 activating the ChatGPT functionality. This will enable the highly versatile large language model to augment the car\u2019s conversation skills. You can join up simply by telling your car \u201cHey Mercedes, I want to join the beta program.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really clear what for, though.\n\nChatGPT app is now available on iPad, adds support for Siri and Shortcuts\n\nThe new ChatGPT app version brings native iPad support to the app, as well as support for using the chatbot with Siri and Shortcuts. Drag and drop is also now available, allowing users to drag individual messages from ChatGPT into other apps.\n\nOn iPad, ChatGPT now runs in full-screen mode, optimized for the tablet\u2019s interface.\n\nMay 2023\n\nTexas judge orders all AI-generated content must be declared and checked\n\nThe Texas federal judge has added a requirement that any attorney appearing in his court must attest that \u201cno portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence,\u201d or if it was, that it was checked \u201cby a human being.\u201d\n\nChatGPT app expanded to more than 30 countries\n\nThe list of new countries includes Algeria, Argentina, Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Estonia, Ghana, India, Iraq, Israel, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Lithuania, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, Oman, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Qatar, Slovenia, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nChatGPT app is now available in 11 more countries\n\nOpenAI announced in a tweet that the ChatGPT mobile app is now available on iOS in the U.S., Europe, South Korea and New Zealand, and soon more will be able to download the app from the app store. In just six days, the app topped 500,000 downloads.\n\nThe ChatGPT app for iOS is now available to users in 11 more countries \u2014 Albania, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Jamaica, Korea, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and the UK. More to come soon! \u2014 OpenAI (@OpenAI) May 24, 2023\n\nOpenAI launches a ChatGPT app for iOS\n\nChatGPT is officially going mobile. The new ChatGPT app will be free to use, free from ads and will allow for voice input, the company says, but will initially be limited to U.S. users at launch.\n\nWhen using the mobile version of ChatGPT, the app will sync your history across devices \u2014 meaning it will know what you\u2019ve previously searched for via its web interface, and make that accessible to you. The app is also integrated with Whisper, OpenAI\u2019s open source speech recognition system, to allow for voice input.\n\nHackers are using ChatGPT lures to spread malware on Facebook\n\nMeta said in a report on May 3 that malware posing as ChatGPT was on the rise across its platforms. The company said that since March 2023, its security teams have uncovered 10 malware families using ChatGPT (and similar themes) to deliver malicious software to users\u2019 devices.\n\n\u201cIn one case, we\u2019ve seen threat actors create malicious browser extensions available in official web stores that claim to offer ChatGPT-based tools,\u201d said Meta security engineers Duc H. Nguyen and Ryan Victory in a blog post. \u201cThey would then promote these malicious extensions on social media and through sponsored search results to trick people into downloading malware.\u201d\n\nApril 2023\n\nChatGPT parent company OpenAI closes $300M share sale at $27B-29B valuation\n\nVC firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive and K2 Global are picking up new shares, according to documents seen by TechCrunch. A source tells us Founders Fund is also investing. Altogether the VCs have put in just over $300 million at a valuation of $27 billion to $29 billion. This is separate to a big investment from Microsoft announced earlier this year, a person familiar with the development told TechCrunch, which closed in January. The size of Microsoft\u2019s investment is believed to be around $10 billion, a figure we confirmed with our source.\n\nOpenAI previews new subscription tier, ChatGPT Business\n\nCalled ChatGPT Business, OpenAI describes the forthcoming offering as \u201cfor professionals who need more control over their data as well as enterprises seeking to manage their end users.\u201d\n\n\u201cChatGPT Business will follow our API\u2019s data usage policies, which means that end users\u2019 data won\u2019t be used to train our models by default,\u201d OpenAI wrote in a blog post. \u201cWe plan to make ChatGPT Business available in the coming months.\u201d\n\nOpenAI wants to trademark \u201cGPT\u201d\n\nOpenAI applied for a trademark for \u201cGPT,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerative Pre-trained Transformer,\u201d last December. Last month, the company petitioned the USPTO to speed up the process, citing the \u201cmyriad infringements and counterfeit apps\u201d beginning to spring into existence.\n\nUnfortunately for OpenAI, its petition was dismissed last week. According to the agency, OpenAI\u2019s attorneys neglected to pay an associated fee as well as provide \u201cappropriate documentary evidence supporting the justification of special action.\u201d\n\nThat means a decision could take up to five more months.\n\nAuto-GPT is Silicon Valley\u2019s latest quest to automate everything\n\nAuto-GPT is an open-source app created by game developer Toran Bruce Richards that uses OpenAI\u2019s latest text-generating models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to interact with software and services online, allowing it to \u201cautonomously\u201d perform tasks.\n\nDepending on what objective the tool\u2019s provided, Auto-GPT can behave in very\u2026 unexpected ways. One Reddit user claims that, given a budget of $100 to spend within a server instance, Auto-GPT made a wiki page on cats, exploited a flaw in the instance to gain admin-level access and took over the Python environment in which it was running \u2014 and then \u201ckilled\u201d itself.\n\nFTC warns that AI technology like ChatGPT could \u2018turbocharge\u2019 fraud\n\nFTC chair Lina Khan and fellow commissioners warned House representatives of the potential for modern AI technologies, like ChatGPT, to be used to \u201cturbocharge\u201d fraud in a congressional hearing.\n\n\u201cAI presents a whole set of opportunities, but also presents a whole set of risks,\u201d Khan told the House representatives. \u201cAnd I think we\u2019ve already seen ways in which it could be used to turbocharge fraud and scams. We\u2019ve been putting market participants on notice that instances in which AI tools are effectively being designed to deceive people can place them on the hook for FTC action,\u201d she stated.\n\nSuperchat\u2019s new AI chatbot lets you message historical and fictional characters via ChatGPT\n\nThe company behind the popular iPhone customization app Brass, sticker maker StickerHub and others is out today with a new AI chat app called SuperChat, which allows iOS users to chat with virtual characters powered by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. However, what makes the app different from the default experience or the dozens of generic AI chat apps now available are the characters offered which you can use to engage with SuperChat\u2019s AI features.\n\nItaly gives OpenAI to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection watchdog has laid out what OpenAI needs to do for it to lift an order against ChatGPT issued at the end of last month \u2014 when it said it suspected the AI chatbot service was in breach of the EU\u2019s GSPR and ordered the U.S.-based company to stop processing locals\u2019 data.\n\nThe DPA has given OpenAI a deadline \u2014 of April 30 \u2014 to get the regulator\u2019s compliance demands done. (The local radio, TV and internet awareness campaign has a slightly more generous timeline of May 15 to be actioned.)\n\nResearchers discover a way to make ChatGPT consistently toxic\n\nA study co-authored by scientists at the Allen Institute for AI shows that assigning ChatGPT a \u201cpersona\u201d \u2014 for example, \u201ca bad person,\u201d \u201ca horrible person\u201d or \u201ca nasty person\u201d \u2014 through the ChatGPT API increases its toxicity sixfold. Even more concerning, the co-authors found having the conversational AI chatbot pose as certain historical figures, gendered people and members of political parties also increased its toxicity \u2014 with journalists, men and Republicans in particular causing the machine learning model to say more offensive things than it normally would.\n\nThe research was conducted using the latest version, but not the model currently in preview based on OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4.\n\nY Combinator-backed startups are trying to build \u2018ChatGPT for X\u2019\n\nYC Demo Day\u2019s Winter 2023 batch features no fewer than four startups that claim to be building \u201cChatGPT for X.\u201d They\u2019re all chasing after a customer service software market that\u2019ll be worth $58.1 billion by 2023, assuming the rather optimistic prediction from Acumen Research comes true.\n\nHere are the YC-backed startups that caught our eye:\n\nYuma, whose customer demographic is primarily Shopify merchants, provides ChatGPT-like AI systems that integrate with help desk software, suggesting drafts of replies to customer tickets.\n\nBaselit, which uses one of OpenAI\u2019s text-understanding models to allow businesses to embed chatbot-style analytics for their customers.\n\nLasso customers send descriptions or videos of the processes they\u2019d like to automate and the company combines ChatGPT-like interface with robotic process automation (RPA) and a Chrome extension to build out those automations.\n\nBerriAI, whose platform is designed to help developers spin up ChatGPT apps for their organization data through various data connectors.\n\nItaly orders ChatGPT to be blocked\n\nOpenAI has started geoblocking access to its generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in Italy.\n\nItaly\u2019s data protection authority has just put out a timely reminder that some countries do have laws that already apply to cutting edge AI: it has ordered OpenAI to stop processing people\u2019s data locally with immediate effect. The Italian DPA said it\u2019s concerned that the ChatGPT maker is breaching the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and is opening an investigation.\n\nMarch 2023\n\n1,100+ signatories signed an open letter asking all \u2018AI labs to immediately pause for 6 months\u2019\n\nThe letter\u2019s signatories include Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak and Tristan Harris of the Center for Humane Technology, among others. The letter calls on \u201call AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4.\u201d\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nContemporary AI systems are now becoming human-competitive at general tasks,[3] and we must ask ourselves: Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth? Should we automate away all the jobs, including the fulfilling ones? Should we develop nonhuman minds that might eventually outnumber, outsmart, obsolete and replace us? Should we risk loss of control of our civilization? Such decisions must not be delegated to unelected tech leaders. Powerful AI systems should be developed only once we are confident that their effects will be positive and their risks will be manageable.\n\nOpenAI connects ChatGPT to the internet\n\nOpenAI launched plugins for ChatGPT, extending the bot\u2019s functionality by granting it access to third-party knowledge sources and databases, including the web. Available in alpha to ChatGPT users and developers on the waitlist, OpenAI says that it\u2019ll initially prioritize a small number of developers and subscribers to its premium ChatGPT Plus plan before rolling out larger-scale and API access.\n\nOpenAI launches GPT-4, available through ChatGPT Plus\n\nGPT-4 is a powerful image- and text-understanding AI model from OpenAI. Released March 14, GPT-4 is available for paying ChatGPT Plus users and through a public API. Developers can sign up on a waitlist to access the API.\n\nChatGPT is available in Azure OpenAI service\n\nChatGPT is generally available through the Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft\u2019s fully managed, corporate-focused offering. Customers, who must already be \u201cMicrosoft managed customers and partners,\u201d can apply here for special access.\n\nOpenAI launches an API for ChatGPT\n\nOpenAI makes another move toward monetization by launching a paid API for ChatGPT. Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\n\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\n\nOther companies beyond Microsoft joined in on the AI craze by implementing ChatGPT, including OkCupid, Kaito, Snapchat and Discord \u2014 putting the pressure on Big Tech\u2019s AI initiatives, like Google.\n\nOpenAI launches ChatGPT Plus, starting at $20 per month\n\nAfter ChatGPT took the internet by storm, OpenAI launched a new pilot subscription plan for ChatGPT called ChatGPT Plus, aiming to monetize the technology starting at $20 per month. A month prior, OpenAI posted a waitlist for \u201cChatGPT Professional\u201d as the company began to think about monetizing the chatbot.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nOpenAI teases ChatGPT Professional\n\nOpenAI said that it\u2019s \u201cstarting to think about how to monetize ChatGPT\u201d in an announcement on the company\u2019s official Discord server. According to a waitlist link OpenAI posted in Discord, the monetized version will be called ChatGPT Professional. The waitlist document includes the benefits of this new paid version of the chatbot which include no \u201cblackout\u201d windows, no throttling and an unlimited number of messages with ChatGPT \u2014 \u201cat least 2x the regular daily limit.\u201d\n\nDecember 2022\n\nShareGPT lets you easily share your ChatGPT conversations\n\nA week after ChatGPT was released into the wild, two developers \u2014 Steven Tey and Dom Eccleston \u2014 made a Chrome extension called ShareGPT to make it easier to capture and share the AI\u2019s answers with the world.\n\nNovember 2022\n\nChatGPT first launched to the public as OpenAI quietly released GPT-3.5\n\nGPT-3.5 broke cover with ChatGPT, a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that\u2019s essentially a general-purpose chatbot. ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\n\nFAQs:\n\nWhat is ChatGPT?

And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\n\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\n\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\n\nMuch like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\n\nChatGPT\u2019s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been \u201clearning\u201d for a longer period of time than Bard.\n\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\n\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they\u2019ll give canned responses to questions.\n\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\n\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\n\nYes.\n\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\n\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don\u2019t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That\u2019s a problem when you\u2019re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\n\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\n\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\n\nIt\u2019s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\n\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\n\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\n\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\n\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\n\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\n\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\n\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\n\nIt depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can\u2019t necessarily program an entire app\u2019s worth of code. That\u2019s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness \u2014 in other words, the generated code isn\u2019t always appropriate for the specific context in which it\u2019s being used.\n\nCan you save a ChatGPT chat?\n\nYes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet.\n\nAre there alternatives to ChatGPT?\n\nYes. There are multiple AI-powered chatbot competitors such as Together, Google\u2019s Bard and Anthropic\u2019s Claude, and developers are creating open source alternatives. But the latter are harder \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to run today.\n\nThe Google-owned research lab DeepMind claimed that its next LLM, will rival, or even best, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. DeepMind is using techniques from AlphaGo, DeepMind\u2019s AI system that was the first to defeat a professional human player at the board game Go, to make a ChatGPT-rivaling chatbot called Gemini.\n\nApple is developing AI tools to challenge OpenAI, Google and others. The tech giant created a chatbot that some engineers are internally referring to as \u201cApple GPT,\u201d but Apple has yet to determine a strategy for releasing the AI to consumers.\n\nHow does ChatGPT handle data privacy?\n\nOpenAI has said that individuals in \u201ccertain jurisdictions\u201d (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling out this form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression \u201cin accordance with applicable laws\u201d.\n\nThe web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled \u201cOpenAI Personal Data Removal Request\u201d.\n\nIn its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on \u201clegitimate interest\u201d (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out \u2014 when it writes: \u201cSee here for instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.\u201d\n\nWhat controversies have surrounded ChatGPT?\n\nRecently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI\u2019s technology into its bot named Clyde where two users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine (meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm.\n\nAn Australian mayor has publicly announced he may sue OpenAI for defamation due to ChatGPT\u2019s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery. This would be the first defamation lawsuit against the text-generating service.\n\nCNET found itself in the midst of controversy after Futurism reported the publication was publishing articles under a mysterious byline completely generated by AI. The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, was accused of using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect.\n\nSeveral major school systems and colleges, including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim that not every educator agrees with.\n\nThere have also been cases of ChatGPT accusing individuals of false crimes.\n\nWhere can I find examples of ChatGPT prompts?\n\nSeveral marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One is PromptBase. Another is ChatX. More launch every day.\n\nCan ChatGPT be detected?\n\nPoorly. Several tools claim to detect ChatGPT-generated text, but in our tests, they\u2019re inconsistent at best.\n\nAre ChatGPT chats public?\n\nNo. But OpenAI recently disclosed a bug, since fixed, that exposed the titles of some users\u2019 conversations to other people on the service.\n\nWho owns the copyright on ChatGPT-created content or media?\n\nThe user who requested the input from ChatGPT is the copyright owner.\n\nWhat lawsuits are there surrounding ChatGPT?\n\nNone specifically targeting ChatGPT. But OpenAI is involved in at least one lawsuit that has implications for AI systems trained on publicly available data, which would touch on ChatGPT.\n\nAre there issues regarding plagiarism with ChatGPT?\n\nYes. Text-generating AI models like ChatGPT have a tendency to regurgitate content from their training data.",

    "content": "It has been a whirlwind four days for OpenAI, the generative AI poster child behind the smash hit ChatGPT.\n\nSeemingly out of nowhere, the OpenAI board ousted CEO and co-founder Sam Altman and demoted president and co-founder Greg Brockman, who subsequently resigned, paving the way for what looked like a mutiny by staff insisting the founders be reinstated post-haste. By then, Microsoft had already hired Altman and Brockman to head up a new internal AI unit, though, as things transpired, nothing had actually been signed yet, with rumors suggesting that the ousted leaders might actually return to OpenAI after all \u2014 in some capacity, at least.\n\nThe situation remains fluid, and any number of potential outcomes still remain on the table. But the whole debacle has shone a spotlight on the forces that control the burgeoning AI revolution, leading many to question what happens if you go all-in on a centralized proprietary player, and what happens if things then go belly-up?\n\n\u201cThe OpenAI / Microsoft drama underlines one of the big near-term risks with AI \u2014 that this next wave of technology is controlled by the same tiny set of players who have shaped that last era of the internet,\u201d Mark Surman, president and executive director at the Mozilla Foundation, told TechCrunch. \u201cWe might have a chance of avoiding this if GPT-X were responsibly open sourced, giving researchers and startups a shot at making this technology safer, more useful and more trustworthy for people everywhere.\u201d\n\nOpen and shut\n\nIn an open letter published by Mozilla a few weeks back, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun joined some 70 other signatories in calling for more openness in AI development, though that letter has since garnered more than 1,700 signatures. The backdrop stems from Big Tech companies such as OpenAI and Google\u2019s DeepMind calling for more regulation, warning of catastrophic consequences if the AI levers were to meet the wrong hands \u2014 in other words, they argued that proprietary AI is safer than open source.\n\nLeCun et al. disagree.\n\n\u201cYes, openly available models come with risks and vulnerabilities \u2014 AI models can be abused by malicious actors or deployed by ill-equipped developers,\u201d the letter acknowledged. \u201cHowever, we have seen time and time again that the same holds true for proprietary technologies \u2014 and that increasing public access and scrutiny makes technology safer, not more dangerous. The idea that tight and proprietary control of foundational AI models is the only path to protecting us from society-scale harm is naive at best, dangerous at worst.\u201d\n\nOn a personal level, LeCun has accused the big-name AI players of trying to secure \u201cregulatory capture of the AI industry\u201d by lobbying against open AI R&D. And on a company level, Meta is doing all it can to encourage collaboration and \u201copenness,\u201d recently partnering with Hugging Face to launch a new startup accelerator designed to spur adoption of open source AI models.\n\nBut OpenAI was \u2014 up until last week, at least \u2014 still the AI darling everyone wanted to dance with. Countless startups and scale-ups have built businesses atop OpenAI\u2019s proprietary GPT-X large language models (LLMs), and over the weekend hundreds of OpenAI customers reportedly started contacting OpenAI\u2019s rivals, which include Anthropic, Google and Cohere, concerned that their own businesses might be impacted if OpenAI was to disintegrate overnight.\n\nOver-reliance\n\nThe panic has been palpable. But there are precedents from elsewhere in the technology sphere, perhaps most notably that of the cloud computing industry, which became renowned for the way it locked companies in to centralized, vortex-like silos.\n\n\u201cPart of the frenzy around the future of OpenAI is due to too many startups over-relying on their proprietary models,\u201d Luis Ceze, University of Washington computer science professor and OctoML CEO, told TechCrunch in an emailed statement. \u201cIt\u2019s dangerous to put all your chips in one basket \u2014 we saw that in the early cloud days which led to companies shifting to multi-cloud and hybrid environments.\u201d\n\nOn the surface, Microsoft is currently looking like the biggest winner amidst the OpenAI turmoil, as it was already apparently looking to reduce its reliance on OpenAI even though it remains once of its major shareholders. But Facebook\u2019s parent Meta could also stand to benefit, as businesses pursue multi-modal strategies or models with a more \u201copen\u201d ethos embedded.\n\n\u201cOpen source today offers a wide variety of models for companies to essentially diversify,\u201d Ceze added. \u201cBy doing so, these startups can quickly pivot and minimize risk. There is also a major upside \u2014 many of these models already outperform the likes of OpenAI\u2019s in terms [of] price-performance and speed.\u201d\n\nA leaked internal memo from Google earlier this year seemed to express fears that despite the huge advances made by proprietary LLM models from the likes of OpenAI, open source AI would ultimately trump them all. \u201cWe have no moat, and neither does OpenAI,\u201d the document noted.\n\nThe memo in question was in reference to a foundation language model initially leaked from Meta in March, and which gained a fair bit of steam in a short period of time. This highlighted the power and scalability of a more open approach to AI development \u2014 it enables collaboration and experimentation on a level that\u2019s not so easy to replicate with closed models.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting here that despite Meta\u2019s claims, its Llama-branded family of LLMs are not as \u201copen source\u201d as it would like people to believe. Yes, they are available for both research and commercial use cases, but it forbids developers to use Llama for training other models, while app developers with more than 700 million monthly users must request a special license from Meta which it may grant based on its \u201csole discretion\u201d \u2014 basically, anyone but Meta\u2019s Big Tech brethren can use Llama sans permission.\n\nFor sure, Meta isn\u2019t the only company flaunting its \u201copen\u201d approach to AI development \u2014 notably, the likes of Hugging Face, Mistral AI and 01.AI, which have all raised sizeable sums at lofty valuations with similar goals in mind. But as a $900 billion juggernaut with a long history of courting developers through open source endeavors, Meta is perhaps best positioned to capitalize on the mess that OpenAI has created for itself. Its decision to pursue \u201copenness\u201d over \u201cclosedness\u201d seems to be well vindicated right now, and regardless of whether Llama is or isn\u2019t really open source, it\u2019s likely \u201copen enough\u201d for most people.\n\nIt\u2019s still too early to make any surefire claims on what impact the OpenAI fallout will have on LLM development and uptake in the future. Altman and Brockman are undoubtedly steady hands for a commercial AI startup, and they may even return to steward OpenAI. But some might argue that it\u2019s unhealthy that so much focus lies on just a handful of people \u2014 and it\u2019s telling that their departure has created such widespread havoc.",

The best NBA betting apps make it simple and convenient.\n\nBelow, you can check the latest NBA Rookie of the Year odds as posted at online sportsbooks and how to bet on them.\n\nCurrent NBA ROTY odds\n\nCheck the current NBA ROTY odds below. Click on any odds to claim your bonus and get started.\n\nWho are the NBA RoY odds favorites?\n\nVictor Wembanyama: Coach Gregg Popovich's Spurs have a gem in Victor Wembanyama, a generational talent and a strong Rookie of the Year contender. Even with a young roster and potential load management, Wembanyama's undeniable impact is evident.\n\nHis elite defense, highlighted by his 7-foot-4 height and 8-foot wingspan, allows him to dominate where others can't. Offensively, his agility and skill set are unparalleled for his size. If he refines his shooting and continues to adapt to the Spurs' style, as seen in his impressive NBA preseason performance, he'll be a force to reckon with.\n\nScoot Henderson: The Portland Trail Blazers have restructured, placing Henderson as Damian Lillard's successor. Supported by talents such as Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant, much of the Blazers' fortunes hinge on Henderson.\n\nAfter a stellar season with the G League Ignite, expectations for his rookie year are soaring. Known for his strength and agility, and with a promising defense, Henderson is set to become a fan favorite.\n\nChet Holmgren: The Oklahoma City Thunder anticipate a strong season, largely due to Holmgren. Boasting a 7-foot frame and notable skills, Holmgren stands out as a Rookie of the Year contender, underpinned by impressive stats and team impact.\n\nHis wingspan and defensive prowess will challenge opponents. Offensively, he capitalizes on mismatches and has diverse scoring abilities, from the paint to the 3-point line. His underrated passing syncs well with OKC's pace and style.\n\nHow to bet on NBA Rookie of the Year\n\nThe first thing you need when preparing to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, or any other bet, is an account at an online sportsbook.\n\nSigning up for a new betting account doesn\u2019t take much time. Once you visit the online sportsbook you\u2019re interested in, click a \u201csign up\u201d or \u201cregister\u201d button. This will take you to a form for your details. Fill that out and accept the sportsbook\u2019s terms and conditions.\n\nAt that point, you\u2019ll be able to claim your welcome bonus, which you\u2019ll qualify for by following the link on this page from our site to the online sportsbook. If you need to enter a code to get the bonus, you\u2019ll also find that code on our site.\n\nWe urge you to read the requirements for any available promotions and offers before accepting them so you\u2019re aware of any restrictions before betting.\n\nYou can now place your initial deposit, which is easy at online betting sites thanks to various deposit and withdrawal options.\n\nTo bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year, navigate to the basketball section of the sportsbook website, select the NBA, and go to the futures tab.\n\nYou\u2019ll find Rookie of the Year odds, NBA MVP odds, and more there. Select the bet you want to make, enter the amount you want to bet, and finalize your bet slip.\n\nEnsure you\u2019re using only legal online sportsbooks for any type of betting.

It offers favorable odds for almost every bet type, including NBA ROTY betting, and offers a nice variety of deposit and withdrawal options. Additionally, Caesars has a competitive welcome bonus for new players and runs NBA betting promos for existing players.\n\nWhen is the best time for NBA ROTY odds?\n\nThe earlier you bet on NBA ROTY, the better the odds. But you\u2019ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.\n\nConversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.\n\nWhen the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn\u2019t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don\u2019t have the data to craft more specific lines.\n\nOnce the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.\n\nSo, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.\n\nPros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nYou have an opportunity to find better value.\n\nThe betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.\n\nYou\u2019ll find limited information to make an informed bet.\n\nPros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:\n\nPros:\n\nThere is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.\n\nYou don\u2019t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.\n\nCons:\n\nThere is a reduced opportunity to find value.\n\nThe odds may not be as favorable.\n\nKeep in mind that it\u2019s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.\n\nWho are the past NBA ROTY winners?\n\nFor context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.\n\nSeason Player Position Team 2023 Paolo Banchero Forward Orlando Magic 2022 Scottie Barnes Forward Toronto Raptors 2021 LaMelo Ball Guard Charlotte Hornets 2020 Ja Morant Guard Memphis Grizzlies 2019 Luka Don\u010di\u0107 Guard/Forward Dallas Mavericks 2018 Ben Simmons Forward/Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2017 Malcolm Brogdon Guard Milwaukee Bucks 2016 Karl-Anthony Towns Center Minnesota Timberwolves 2015 Andrew Wiggins Forward/Guard Minnesota Timberwolves 2014 Michael Carter-Williams Guard Philadelphia 76ers 2013 Damian Lillard Guard Portland Trail Blazers 2012 Kyrie Irving Guard Cleveland Cavaliers 2011 Blake Griffin Forward Los Angeles Clippers 2010 Tyreke Evans Guard/Forward Sacramento Kings\n\nWhat other NBA futures can I bet on?\n\nRookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:\n\nIn addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you\u2019ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.\n\nThe NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds. That means every online betting site always has a great selection of NBA odds.",

Live betting markets and SGPs are often enhanced with specific profit boosts on the site and the interface is one of the cleanest and easiest to use among the offerings. Unlike its competitors though, FanDuel does not offer a rewards program for its customers at this time.\n\n\n\n4. BetMGM Sportsbook: The signup offer at BetMGM caters more to larger players, a $1500 risk free offer which will credit a customer with bonus bets in the event their first real money wager loses. The boosts and risk free offers on the site cater to smaller players as the limits for those tokens are generally less than the other sites. With a friendly interface and a rewards program that can be redeemed for bonus bets or MGM Resort credit, this sportsbook is one of the best in the business for a reason.\n\n5. Caesars Sportsbook: Similar to MGM, the rewards program is what Caesars is most known for in that customers can redeem their wagering credits for use at Caesars properties. New customers can get up to $1000 in bonus bets if they lose their first bet. The sportsbook offers an extensive betting menu and specializes in specific boosts related to your home state teams.\n\n6. Bet365 Sportsbook: One of the largest betting operators in Europe that is rolling out in selected states to gain market share in the U.S. Their signup offer of bet $1, get $365 might be the most generous of any competitor in the space. While the SGP offerings aren't as extensive as other sportsbooks, the wagering menu, specifically rare leagues and sports are covered by Bet365.\n\nKentucky Sports Betting History\n\nKentucky has always been the thoroughbred horse betting capital of the U.S., but as of the fall of 2023, it added sports betting to its wagering menu. On March 31, 2023, Kentucky became the 34th state to legalize sports betting and the 25th with online/mobile access. Retail locations opened on September 7 and Kentucky online sports betting became legal on September 28.\n\nThe betting menu for Kentuckians is exhaustive in that they are able to legally wager on all major professional, collegiate and international sports, unlike other sports betting states. With excitement building among customers in the state for Kentucky sports gambling, it's feasible that Kentucky generates over $1 billion in Kentucky sports betting handle by the end of 2023.\n\nKentucky Sportsbook Apps to Know\n\nSportsbook Platforms App Features* Fanatics iOS and Android apps FanCash Rewards, bettable search, Discover page, cash outs, easy sign up, secure deposit, Withdrawal Tracker FanDuel iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web Quick bets, secure deposits, horse racing, casino, cash outs, fast payouts DraftKings iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCasino, fast withdrawals, secure deposits BetMGM iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nEasy deposits and withdrawals, 24/7 access, safe and secure transactions Caesars iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCaesars Rewards, casino, Quick Picks Bet365 iOS and Android apps, desktop and mobile web\n\nCash outs, personalized display, alerts, edit bets, My Teams, search, sports stats\n\nSports Betting on Kentucky (and Nearby) Teams\n\nKentucky Wildcats: One of the most iconic college basketball programs in the nation, the Kentucky Wildcats should be an extremely popular betting option for Bluegrass State residents. The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.\n\nLouisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.\n\nWestern Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.\n\nCincinnati Bengals: With no \"Big Four\" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.\n\nCincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.\n\nTop Kentucky betting terms for new bettors\n\nAgainst the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.\n\nMoney line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.\n\nOutright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.\n\nOver/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.\n\nPlayer prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.\n\nUnderdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.\n\nFavorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.\n\nConsensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.\n\nFutures: While money line, against the spread and over/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.\n\nParlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.\n\nJuice: Also known as \"The Vig\" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.\n\nPush: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.\n\nLive/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads/totals.\n\nYou can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona.",

If you can make some successful bets, that should mean a nice profit given the fact that with the prelive offer you received $100 Bonus Bets for free, and with the welcome offer you only have to make a $5 bet up front in order to receive the $200 in Bonus Bets.\n\nWhat makes the FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer special?\n\nThe FanDuel Sportsbook offer is great for many reasons.

Finally, $200 in bonus bets is quite generous and if you make some winning bets you\u2019ll be able to have a nice bankroll right away without any significant expense. And with the $100 in Bonus Bets for those signing up by Jan. 10, the offer is even more generous.\n\nDraftKings Vermont promo code\n\nDraftKings is likewise already known to Vermont sports fans thanks to its popular DFS site, and many will surely be gravitating to the DraftKings Sportsbook as well. DraftKings also has a prelive offer already available to Vermont users. Be aware, though, that those who accept the prelive offer will not be eligible for DraftKings' welcome offer later on.\n\nIf you use our links and sign up for a DraftKings Sportsbook VT account between now and the moment the site goes live on Jan. 11, you will receive $200 in Bonus Bets, issued as eight $25 Bonus Bets.

The deposit match bonus offer is unique as well, although not all new users will likely try to take advantage of it.\n\nBetMGM Vermont promo code\n\nKnown as the \u201cKing of Sportsbooks,\u201d BetMGM Sportbook is another favorite around the US and will surely be one should it launch in Vermont.

    "content": "Welcome back to The Interchange, where we take a look at the hottest fintech news of the previous week. If you want to receive The Interchange directly in your inbox every Sunday, head here to sign up! After a bit of a quiet period, things in the world of fintech picked up in a big way this past week. We wrote about some notable fundraises, how PayPal was hit with an antitrust lawsuit, how Bolt is trying to move on after an SEC probe, and much more.\n\nRainforest takes on the bigger players\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that we\u2019re pitched companies that feel like they are taking on bigger players in a really meaningful way. This past week, I wrote about Rainforest, an Atlanta-based startup that is taking on incumbents such as Fiserv and FIS, as well as trying to take market share from other fintechs such as Stripe with its offering. Rainforest works with software companies to help them embed financial services and payments into their platforms. In an interview with TechCrunch, CEO and co-founder Joshua Silver respectfully disagreed with a16z general partner Angela Strange about her 2019 statement that every company would become a fintech. In his view, most software companies don\u2019t actually want to be fintechs and deal with all the regulatory and compliance issues that go with that. They really just want to be able to accept payments and generate more revenue from being able to do so.\n\nAccel led the company\u2019s $8.5 million seed round, which included participation from Infinity Ventures, BoxGroup, The Fintech Fund, Tech Square Ventures, and Ardent Venture Partners.\n\nIt\u2019s always cool to see startups outside the coasts growing, and Silver\u2019s confidence that what Rainforest is building will make it a formidable player in the space feels like it has merit. Founded in 2022, the startup has seen impressive growth in a short period of time, securing client commitments representing more than $500 million in processing, with much of the volume guaranteed.\n\nSilver believes the company\u2019s exclusive focus on software companies only gives it an edge.\n\n\u201cNone of the modern processors were built specifically for software platforms. Most of them were built directly for merchants, and they\u2019ve all had to retrofit their platforms even to accommodate basic payment processing and reporting functions for software companies,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nAs such, the startup is capturing volume as software platforms migrate from legacy processors such as Fiserv and FIS. As that happens, it competes against companies like Stripe (and its Connect product) to embed financial services and payments.\n\nNik Milanovi\u0107 of The Fintech Fund posted on X that he believes that one of the biggest stories of the next decade will be about Stripe, \u201cwhich looks invincible from the outside, losing market share to nimble competitors.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI think Rainforest is going to be a big part of that story.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Infinity Ventures\u2019 Jeremy Jonker and former PayPal exec said he\u2019s been in payments for 13 years and has \u201cnever before seen anything like Rainforest.\u201d He told me via email that \u201cJoshua\u2019s background as a software platform founder and then as a payments consultant is a big part of the secret sauce. He\u2019s lived the pain of payments himself, and you can\u2019t underestimate the power of being in your clients\u2019 shoes. He knew that taking on risk and compliance burdens, and offering features like data portability, would be hugely attractive to platforms. We also like that it\u2019s not just him who has a wealth of payments experience \u2014 it\u2019s the entire team he\u2019s recruited to the company. Many are longtime payments and SaaS vets who knew there was so much potential for a better provider, and now they\u2019ve built it themselves.\u201d\n\nListen to TC+ editor Alex Wilhelm and I talk more about how there\u2019s plenty of market share to go around in Friday\u2019s episode of the Equity podcast below. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nPayPal is being sued for alleged \u201cDraconian\u201d payment policies\n\nOn October 5, Mary Ann broke the news that PayPal has been hit with a class action lawsuit by consumers represented by law firm Hagens Berman alleging that the fintech giant\u2019s anti-steering rules stifle competition against lower-cost payment platforms such as Stripe and Shopify. Specifically, according to an investigation conducted by the firm\u2019s consumer rights attorneys, PayPal has subjected consumers to excess charges when purchasing from online merchants that accept PayPal or Venmo.\n\nSomeone commented on social media that they didn\u2019t see the problem with what PayPal is doing and questioned whether or not Visa and Mastercard do the same thing. So I went back to the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, who noted that the \u201canti-steering rules\u201d are not the first of their kind. They said: \u201cVisa and MasterCard once imposed similar anti-steering rules on merchants accepting their cards but, after the Justice Department sued the networks for antitrust violations, they agreed in 2010 to eliminate their anti-steering rules as part of the settlement. With payments transitioning into the digital realm, PayPal has simply ripped a page right from the Visa and MasterCard [sic] playbook.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Patrick McGahan, a partner at Scott+Scott who focuses on antitrust litigation, had an interesting take that actually involves both of those card giants. He told TechCrunch that the case illustrates that \u201cthe tensions between merchants and the payment system providers are not over, and that litigation regarding this key cost faced by merchants is likely to continue for some time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cPlatform companies that operate as gatekeepers in their market, such as PayPal, will continue to be the subject of antitrust litigation as a result of the significant fees they charge. PayPal\u2019s fees are, however, driven by the costs imposed upon them by the dominant card schemes, Visa, Mastercard and American Express. So, we can expect PayPal will respond to this suit by arguing that it is as much of a price taker as the merchants themselves, and that the terms imposed upon it by the card schemes drive some of its anti-steering rules.\u201d\n\nPayPal did not respond to requests for comment. \u2014 Mary Ann\n\nBolt CEO gets frank about SEC probe\n\nBolt Financial CEO Maju Kuruvilla told me in an interview that the one-click checkout company is putting a recent U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission probe behind it and is moving on.\n\n\u201cIt obviously is a very, very involved process, but we\u2019re really happy to put that behind us,\u201d Kuruvilla told TechCrunch. \u201cWe look forward to focusing on the momentum for the business and how we can help the retailers, especially the big retailers who are looking to us to innovate for them, because this is a tough year for retailers.\u201d\n\nYou might remember that Bolt, which provides checkout technology to merchants, and its co-founder Ryan Breslow, were subpoenaed last year by the SEC to investigate whether the company violated any securities laws during fundraising in 2021 when Bolt was seeking its $355 million Series E round that valued the company at $11 billion.\n\nThe investigation took about 15 months, but news of that probe didn\u2019t go public until July of 2023. Shortly thereafter on August 23, the SEC said, in a letter viewed by TechCrunch, it was not recommending an enforcement action for the company.\n\nKuruvilla spoke with me about how, exactly, the company can put something like this behind it, what it told customers and what\u2019s next. Read more. \u2014 Christine\n\nWeekly News\n\nBanking-as-a-service startup Synapse confirmed Friday that it laid off 86 people, or about 40% of the company. The San Francisco\u2013based company, which operates a platform enabling banks and fintech companies to easily develop financial services, has been open about past layoffs. In June, CEO Sankaet Pathak wrote in a blog post that the company had let go of 18% of its workforce as \u201cthe current macroeconomic conditions\u201d had begun to impact its clients and platforms, affecting its anticipated growth. More here.\n\nVisa plans to invest $100 million in companies developing generative AI technologies and applications \u201cthat will impact the future of commerce and payments,\u201d Mary Ann reports. Visa Ventures head David Roff told TechCrunch that the fintech giant has \u201ca lot of flexibility\u201d with regards to how many investments it would make out of the new fund, and average check size. More here.\n\nAs reported by Manish Singh, \u201cIndian unicorn fintech Slice is merging with North East Small Finance Bank after receiving the approval from the central bank, in an extremely rare feat that has eluded many tech giants, top financial startups and tycoons for decades. Slice \u2014 which earlier offered credit card\u2013like cards and at peak issued over 400,000 cards in a month, more than any other fintech or bank \u2014 said the merger with the Guwahati-headquartered bank will allow the combined entity to better serve their shared mission and reach more consumers who currently lack access to basic banking services.\u201d More here.\n\n\u201cCRED grew its operating revenue by a staggering 255% to $168.1 million in the financial year ending March as the fintech startup, which garners an unusually high level of attention, finds rising adoption of its lending and commerce offerings among India\u2019s affluent individuals. The Bengaluru-headquartered startup had a total income of about $50 million in the financial year ending March last year and $11.4 million in the prior year. More here from Manish Singh.\n\nBrex co-CEO and co-founder Henrique Dubugras chose the very picturesque island Fernando de Noronha in northeastern Brazil to be the location of four days of festivities around his marriage to software engineer Laura Fiuza, Brazilian publication Globo reported last week. Some 400 guests are reportedly attending the wedding, which led to the closing of the Forte dos Rem\u00e9dios \u2014 one of the island\u2019s main tourist attractions \u2014 for more than a week, according to Globo.

    "content": "In the runup to the 2020 election, a small news organization saw an opportunity.\n\nThe Epoch Times directed millions of dollars in advertising toward supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and published dozens of articles parroting his lies about the election \u2014 resulting in huge growth to its audience and its coffers.\n\nThe strategy garnered criticism from fact-checking groups and got it banned from advertising on Facebook, but it ultimately paid off \u2014 putting the once-fringe newspaper on a path that perhaps only its leader, who claims to have supernatural powers, could have foreseen.\n\nToday, The Epoch Times is one of the country\u2019s most successful and influential conservative news organizations. It\u2019s powered by Falun Gong, a religious group persecuted in China, which launched The Epoch Times as a free propaganda newsletter more than two decades ago to oppose the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nFunded through aggressive online and real-world marketing campaigns and big-money conservative donors, The Epoch Times now boasts to be the country\u2019s fourth-largest newspaper by subscriber count. (Unlike most major newspapers, The Epoch Times isn't audited by the two major independent collectors of circulation data.) The nonprofit has amassed a fortune, growing its revenue by a staggering 685% in two years, to $122 million in 2021, according to the group\u2019s most recent tax records.\n\nIts editorial vision \u2014 fueled by a right-wing slant and conspiracy theories \u2014 is on display in recent reports on how \u201cJan. 6 Capitol Hill Security Footage Challenges Key Narratives\u201d and \u201cMeteorologists, Scientists Explain Why There Is \u2018No Climate Emergency.\u2019\u201d Its video series include a documentary-style film alleging widespread vaccine injury and death and an expos\u00e9 of an alleged world government agenda to harm farmers, cull the population and force survivors to eat bugs.\n\nWhat The Epoch Times lacks in standards, it makes up for in style and form, mirroring the aesthetics of journalism \u2014 a feature that\u2019s attracted subscribers and big-name supporters.\n\nAnti-vaccine activist and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls The Epoch Times a daily read, among his most trusted news sources. \u201cThey have a real bias against China, but on other reporting, they\u2019re very courageous and it\u2019s real journalism,\u201d Kennedy said in an interview with NBC News this summer.\n\nIn July, Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., recited the history of The Epoch Times into the congressional record. \u201cThis is all about one word: freedom,\u201d Norman said.\n\nThe Epoch Times has yet to throw its weight behind a candidate for 2024, but heading into the election cycle, it is moving into new and bigger office spaces and production studios in California, hiring mainstream news veterans who are not affiliated with Falun Gong, and revving up an ad-buying blitz.\n\n\u201cThey achieved the goal,\u201d said Brendan Steinhauser, a Texas-based Republican strategist hired by The Epoch Times in 2018 to open doors to conservative politicians and players. Steinhauser said that a series of interviews and introductions with politicians and media figures at that year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference offered access to a wider conservative audience. The Epoch Times was a \u201csupporting sponsor\u201d for this year\u2019s conference.\n\n\u201cThey take advantage of every opportunity,\u201d Steinhauser, who is not currently working for The Epoch Times, continued. \u201cThey studied digital marketing. They learned how to work the system. And they did it. They're smarter than people give them credit for, and they\u2019ve got the money to back it up.\u201d\n\nAs a nonprofit, The Epoch Times is exempt from most federal taxes. Its mission, according to tax filings, is independent journalism, \u201coutside of political interests and the pursuit of profit, for the public benefit and to be truly responsible to society.\u201d\n\nNeither the chairman nor the editor-in-chief of The Epoch Times returned multiple requests for comment. Representatives for The Epoch Times have previously defended it against critical reporting, labeling reports of the paper\u2019s conservative mission, and its penchant for misinformation, \u201csmears.\u201d\n\nEpoch Times representatives also deny an affiliation with Falun Gong, despite the two groups\u2019 clear financial and organizational ties: The Epoch Times board members and most staff are Falun Gong practitioners. The nonprofits behind The Epoch Times and Friends of Falun Gong, the movement\u2019s advocacy organization, share executives and provide grants and services to each other, according to tax filings. And the newspaper, along with a digital production company and the heavily advertised dance troupe Shen Yun, make up a nonprofit network that the leader of the religious movement calls \u201cour media.\u201d\n\nLi Hongzhi during an interview in New York in 1999. Henny Ray Abrams / AFP via Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, Li Hongzhi came to speak to his followers, volunteers who worked at The Epoch Times\u2019 offices in Manhattan. Li\u2019s instructions for the group were simple. They needed to reach people outside of the Falun Gong religious community. And they needed to make money. A lot of it.\n\n\u201cEnsure that the paper gains a foothold in ordinary society and turns profitable,\u201d Li said.\n\nFalun Gong \u2014 or Falun Dafa, as some followers call it \u2014 is a kind of personal development movement started by Li in China in 1992. It combines tenets of Buddhism and Taoism, and followers practice with meditation and flowing breath and movement exercises, and by studying Li\u2019s teachings.\n\nTo his followers, Li is a God-like figure who can levitate, walk through walls and see into the future. His ultra-conservative and controversial teachings include a rejection of modern science, art and medicine, and a denunciation of homosexuality, feminism and general worldliness.\n\nIn 1999, after thousands of Li\u2019s followers silently protested its repression in Beijing, China banned it altogether. Labeling it a cult, the Chinese government confiscated Falun Gong books, blocked websites, closed teaching centers and arrested practitioners. Human rights groups reported a brutal crackdown: Some adherents were sent to labor camps; others were tortured and killed.\n\nFalun Gong followers meditate outside the U.S. Capitol in Washington in 1999. Joyce Naltchayan / AFP via Getty Images file\n\nInternational human rights organizations condemned China\u2019s attempted eradication. In the U.S., where Li and some of his practitioners had fled, a new collection of followers organized a campaign to raise awareness and sympathy with parades, demonstrations and pamphlets that touted the benefits of Falun Gong and the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nThe Epoch Times was born out of that leafleting campaign. Started in Georgia in 2000 by John Tang, a Falun Gong practitioner who remains its CEO, in essence it was a Chinese-language public relations newsletter. The group\u2019s long-term goals were ambitious: to expose the Chinese Communist Party and to save the world in a supernatural war against communism.\n\nThrough the early aughts, The Epoch Times grew from an online effort to a weekly physical newspaper, with a home base in New York and a TV production company, New Tang Dynasty Television. It raised money from followers and was staffed by unpaid volunteers. It ran aggregated articles on international issues from Voice of America next to Thanksgiving Day explainers, dispatches from Falun Gong parades, and expos\u00e9s on atrocities alleged to have been committed by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nBy 2019, it had gone mostly digital and was spending millions of dollars on creating a network of Facebook pages and groups and running aggressive pro-Trump ad campaigns. The move toward explicit support of Republicans, despite Li\u2019s teachings to stay away from U.S. politics, was foreshadowed by Li\u2019s comments at a Falun Gong conference a year before.\n\nLi said that Falun Gong\u2019s media ought to put a \u201cconstructive\u201d spin on the news, to advance the group\u2019s aims. It wasn\u2019t wrong, he said, to favorably cover a politician who shared Falun Gong\u2019s conservative values and whose goals aligned with their own.\n\n\u201cIf someone comes along now who can help to halt the downward spiral that the world is in, then he is truly someone extraordinary!\u201d Li said. \u201cHe would in effect be helping us! Wouldn\u2019t he be helping us to save people?\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times also employed a tactic more often associated with fake news content farms and scammers than news organizations, creating a network of inspiring and cute-content pages and fake accounts to inflate The Epoch Times' reach.\n\nIn 2019, following reporting by NBC News, Facebook found that The Epoch Times had \u201cleveraged foreign actors posing as Americans to push political content\u201d and banned it from future advertising, citing a violation of policies, including trying to circumvent review systems.\n\nUndeterred, The Epoch Times pivoted to video, specifically YouTube, spending millions on internet-infamous ads featuring Roman Balmakov, a former Epoch Times delivery person who now hosts the online show Facts Matter. In the ads, Balmakov rails against the mainstream media, communism and the persecution of Trump.\n\nThe Epoch Times also revisited a tried-and-true strategy that the original anti-communism newspaper had been built on \u2014 free physical copies. Instead of boxes on street corners, this time The Epoch Times printed and distributed unsolicited special editions of the paper from California to the Carolinas to the U.K. In Philadelphia alone in 2020, the company mailed 280,000 free copies of its newspaper, \u201cto increase subscription,\u201d according to tax documents.\n\nThe aggressive online and real-life marketing campaigns paid off. The group reported $76 million in subscription revenue in 2021, compared to nearly $7 million in 2019. A former employee of a regional Epoch Times operation who asked not to be identified because he feared retribution said that in order to send the papers to the most likely customers, they bought lists of addresses from data brokers, specifically for conservatives aged 60 and over. And many of the new subscribers are seniors, according to an employee\u2019s account shared at a Falun Gong conference.\n\nBut hundreds of online complaints suggest that not all of the new customers are satisfied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had the terrible misfortune of being subscribed to the Epoch Times without my consent,\u201d one reads. Another says: \u201cI want to stop receiving Epoch Times emails. That is all I want.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times print newspaper in Augusta, Ga., in 2020. Elijah Nouvelage / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nAs The Epoch Times\u2019 marketing strategy shifted, so did the content \u2014 and by 2020, it became a megaphone for the U.S.\u2019s most extreme right-wing stories.\n\nThere was plenty to write about: An election marred by disinformation, the bubbling culture wars and, most helpful for a media company missioned with ending the Chinese Communist Party, a pandemic originating from China provided endless opportunities for takes that aligned with hawkish conservatives and conspiracy theorists.\n\nThe Epoch Times was early to lay blame on China for Covid \u2014 labeling it the \u201cCCP Virus\u201d in its coverage. (The origin of the outbreak is unknown; the best evidence still points to natural transmission from an animal market.) China\u2019s documented handling of the virus, including withholding information from researchers, a crackdown on whistleblowers and an authoritarian public health response, added credibility to The Epoch Times\u2019 unproven claims.\n\n\u201cThe dynamic for The Epoch Times changed in 2020, partly because of their criticism of China around Covid,\u201d said A.J. Bauer, an assistant journalism professor at the University of Alabama who studies conservative media. \u201cAn entire new kind of ecosystem of Covid deniers and skeptics overlapped with right-wing media and were citing and drawing heavily upon The Epoch Times.\u201d\n\nThe Epoch Times\u2019 subscription page began hosting glowing testimonials from Steve Bannon, Glenn Beck and the far-right Arizona congressman Paul Gosar. The organization became a reliable source for misinformation around Covid, its treatments and the vaccines.\n\nThe Epoch Times was also an early and aggressive promoter of election misinformation, according to the Election Integrity Partnership, a coalition of researchers that documented misinformation and the 2020 vote. The group cited the news organization as a \u201crepeat spreader\u201d of false and misleading voter fraud stories as well as a major promoter of debunked conspiracy theories around Dominion voting machines and the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, aimed at overturning the election results. Months after the election, The Epoch Times refused to acknowledge the results.\n\nWith the new bedfellows came a new revenue stream. Though Falun Gong practitioners had been a reliable source of small donations in previous years, in 2020 the group started to receive gifts and grants from big money conservative donors.\n\nWhile The Epoch Times is not required to list its donors, it reported $8.4 million in revenue from contributions and grants in 2020 and 2021. Tax documents from that period filed by scores of donors, accessed through ProPublica\u2019s nonprofit explorer, show some of those funds came from conservative donors and foundations.\n\nIn 2021, The Epoch Times received $55,750 from the National Christian Charitable Foundation, which connects anonymous donors with Christian causes, and $31,000 from Donors Trust, a fund for conservative and libertarian donors. Smaller donations came from individuals \u2014 real estate agents, investors and surgeons among them \u2014 and small family foundations, most of which support right-wing causes, including evangelical Christian groups, anti-vaccine groups and far-right media organizations.\n\nMost of the donors contacted by NBC News did not respond to interview requests; two declined.\n\nThe Epoch Times is pouring its revenue back into its own organization and others connected to the Falun Gong religious movement.\n\nIn the first half of this year, The Epoch Times spent 65% more on ads than in the first six months of 2022, with about half of its budget going to the X platform, formerly Twitter, according to the market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. Other recent ad buys were made on the right-wing sites Drudge Report, Breitbart and Rumble.\n\nThe Epoch Times paid a company called Data Managing Corporation $2.7 million for advertising services in 2021, according to tax documents. The company\u2019s listed address is a single-family home in New Jersey owned by a reporter for The Epoch Times, who did not return requests for comment.\n\nIn addition to running its business, The Epoch Times provided about $30 million in grants to its own affiliates and connected organizations in 2021, including $10.4 million to the dance troupe Shen Yun, and $8.3 million to New Tang Dynasty, which produces videos.\n\nThe three groups, united under the Falun Gong religious movement, made up a nearly quarter-billion dollar industry in 2021, according to tax documents. Li holds that the Falun Gong messages, shared in articles, videos and dance performances, will result in the salvation of humankind as the end of the world nears.",

    "content": "Week 10 in the NFL had some of the league's best teams not playing. But that didn't stop the excitement, with five teams winning on walk-off field goals and more games coming right down to the wire.\n\nWith that, there were some surprising results and expected domination. Some favorites dug deep to win. Some underdogs turned in shocking upsets.\n\nPutting the latest wins and losses into a blender, here's Sporting News' updated look at how all teams stack up against each other, 1-32 going into Week 11:\n\nNFL WEEK 11 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread\n\nNFL power rankings Week 11\n\n1. Philadelphia Eagles 8-1 (previous week: 1)\n\nThe Eagles enjoyed a bye trying to get a little healthier for the more difficult stretch run in a top-heavy NFC as they have tough games at the Chiefs (the Super Bowl 57 rematch), vs. the Bills, vs. 49ers and at the Cowboys in the next four. They still look like the conference team to beat as they have proved they still win in many ways around Jalen Hurts.\n\n2. Kansas City Chiefs 7-2 (3)\n\nThe Chiefs had a pretty good week off given they jumped back into the AFC's top seed and home-field advantage spot with the Ravens losing. They already are rolling defensively and expect them to figure out a lot more around Patrick Mahomes after the key Andy Reid bye.\n\n3. Detroit Lions 7-2 (5)\n\nThe Lions are becoming like the Eagles, and that's what makes them the second-best team in the NFC. They can win shootouts with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and their passing game. They also can dominate with the running game. They can win with offense or defense. Dan Campbell is coach of the year.\n\n4. San Francisco 49ers 6-3 (8)\n\nThe 49ers had a surprise offensive get-well game in Jacksonville with Brock Purdy leading the way and all his key supporting weapons doing damage, even without Christian McCaffrey scoring. The biggest development was the defense going back to dominating a good offense.\n\n5. Baltimore Ravens 7-3 (2)\n\nThe Ravens' offense is just fine with the running and passing of Lamar Jackson, but he still can't afford to make big mistakes, which he did vs. the Browns. The defense needs to pick up the pieces, too, stat, ahead of facing the Bengals on a short week.\n\n6. Miami Dolphins 6-3 (6)\n\nThe Dolphins got a much-needed bye to figure out how to beat the better teams in the league. Their defense should be getting a little better to support their often explosive offense. They should feel good about a Week 11 rebound vs. the Raiders.\n\n7. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-3 (9)\n\nThe Steelers are playing the way Mike Tomlin wants, with the running game rolling to big totals with Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris and the defense doing what it needs, more so vs. pass than run, in key moments. You can't argue with the overachieving results.\n\n8. Cleveland Browns 6-3 (10)\n\nThe Browns proved they can win games with defense in another way, with big plays. They also have more offensive pop when Deshaun Watson plays well and the running game doesn't slump. Their playoff hopes look much better after their stunning comeback vs. the Ravens.\n\n9. Jacksonville Jaguars 6-3 (4)\n\nThe Jaguars got an NFC wake-up call against the 49ers, who were much more prepared after a Week 9 bye than they were. Jacksonville needs to forget that debacle and get back on track, stat. The team gets a division double vs. Tennessee and Houston before facing Cincinnati.\n\n10. Dallas Cowboys 6-3 (11)\n\nThe Cowboys took advantage of their \"no contest\" vs. the Giants at home with Dak Prescott continuing to ball as a passer and runner. They need to keep the defense and running game success, too, in bigger games going forward.\n\nMORE: Inside the Cowboys historic offensive explosion vs. Giants\n\n11. Seattle Seahawks 6-3 (13)\n\nThe Seahawks needed every ounce of their offense around Geno Smith to rally to beat the Commanders, but the get-well performance worked well for him, Kenneth Walker and the wide receivers. The defense could be more consistent.\n\n12. Minnesota Vikings 6-4 (14)\n\nThe new man on the Vikings, Josh Dobbs, keeps producing the same results they were enjoying offensively with Kirk Cousins, thanks to more help from the running game for Kevin O'Connell and the defense overall under Brian Flores. Their 0-3 and 1-4 starts are distant memories as the Vikings look for a sixth straight win in Week 11 vs. Denver.\n\n13. Houston Texans 5-4 (16)\n\nThe Texans are looking great with C.J. Stroud leading their offense and now they've found some running game, too. The defense is just making enough plays to put them in position to win high-scoring games. Houston is a legitimate playoff contender under rookie coach DeMeco Ryans.\n\n14. Cincinnati Bengals 5-4 (7)\n\nThe Bengals are battling some key injuries, leaving them much less room for error. Unfortunately, Joe Burrow made key mistakes and the defense wilted against run and pass at home in the loss to the Texans.\n\n15. Buffalo Bills 5-5 (12)\n\nThe Bills fell right into the trap game against the Broncos at home, losing because of more mistakes from Josh Allen. The defense can't tolerate those mistakes with all of its injuries.\n\n16. Las Vegas Raiders 5-5 (22)\n\nThe Raiders are hot, having won two consecutive games for interim coach Antonio Pierce, bringing up flashbacks to the playoff push they made with Rich Bisaccia in 2021. They are right back in the AFC wild-card race with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Vikings ahead.\n\n17. New Orleans Saints 5-5 (15)\n\nThe Saints will go into a bye not knowing what do at quarterback. with Derek Carr further hurting his right shoulder and needed to be checked for a concussion. Jameis Winston did provide a spark, too little too late at Minnesota. But the division lead is precarious with poor QB play overall.\n\n19. Indianapolis Colts 5-5 (19)\n\nThe Colts stopped scoring at least 20 points in every game during their ugly, run-heavy victory in Germany vs. the Patriots. At least Jonathan Taylor is doing his normal things and the defense is playing well again while Gardner Minshew looks meh.\n\n18. Los Angeles Chargers 4-5 (17)\n\nThe Chargers got well offensively with Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler against the Lions. But the defense went back to crumbling vs. big pass plays and added wilting against the run. The pressure is right back on Brandon Staley with a trip to Green Bay next.\n\n20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-5 (23)\n\nBaker Mayfield and the offense is back on track to move the ball well after a brief midseason slump. They're still not lighting it up, but the Bucs are back to playing smart complementary football with their defense rebounding and still might have found a long-term QB answer.\n\n21. New York Jets 4-5 (18)\n\nAaron Rodgers can't come back soon enough, and going for a December miracle might be too late after two straight key losses to the Chargers and Raiders. Zach Wilson will always cap the potential of a talented offense that keeps making mistakes. The Bills and Dolphins in back-to-back division games next might be their season.\n\n22. Denver Broncos 4-5 (24)\n\nThe Broncos got another big win against a AFC power, sandwiching their Week 9 bye with upsets over the Chiefs and Bills. The offense has hit a balanced grooved with Russell Wilson and the defense is making a lot more plays, too.\n\n23. Washington Commanders 4-5 (21)\n\nThe Commanders should be pleased about Sam Howell and the offense showing more fight with additional weapons and the running backs look better all-around again. But the reeling defense and pass protection continue to be un-winnable assets.\n\n24. Atlanta Falcons 4-5 (20)\n\nThe Falcons were forced into another QB change because of injury. They found a few more answers offensively but that position still made it an overall mess. The defense also doesn't seem to be well prepared to different styles of offenses.\n\n25. Green Bay Packers 3-6 (25)\n\nThe Packers saw some improved work from Jordan Love and his young weapons as they spread the ball well in the passing game, but the run defense woes and key holes in coverage have all but doomed their playoff hopes.\n\n26. Los Angeles Rams 3-6 (26)\n\nThe Rams are hoping to find a few more answers during a bye, as Sean McVay has seen his good coaching job earlier in the season go by the wayside with key offensive injuries. They need Matthew Stafford to help save face the rest of the way or the season will look a lot like 2022.\n\n27. Tennessee Titans 3-6 (27)\n\nWill Levis is going through rookie lumps after his dazzling debut as the brutal offensive line woes exacerbated by injuries are getting to him and the entire Titans offense. The Titans still need to keep starting him, because they can't overcome those systemic problems or those in overall pass defense.\n\n28. Chicago Bears 3-7 (29)\n\nThe Bears don't care how they win, but they should be pleased their running game and defense bailed out their limited passing game with Tyson Bagent to secure another win in Week 10. They will hope to finish strong with Justin Fields soon.\n\n29. Arizona Cardinals 2-8 (32)\n\nThe Cardinals got an immediate spark for their offense with Kyler Murray and James Conner back. They also seemed invigorated for Jonathan Gannon on defense and special teams. Look for the Cardinals to finish strong and play a whole lot of spoiler.\n\n30. New England Patriots 2-8 (28)\n\nThe Patriots tried to win a game by hiding Mac Jones and their quarterbacks in general. They almost pulled it off with the running game dominating and short-handed defense making a lot of plays, but they didn't see the results in Germany ahead of a tough bye for Bill Belichick.\n\n31. New York Giants 2-8 (30)\n\nThe Giants can just flush away this season without Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor. The injuries go to their offense early and remained relentless, and now their defense is falling apart, too. The question is, will Brian Daboll get a massive mulligan after his rookie playoff leadership?\n\n32. Carolina Panthers 1-8 (31)\n\nThe Panthers found better defense and special teams to keep them in the game in Chicago, but Bryce Young still can't unlock a limited passing game and the offensive line and running game hasn't help nearly enough.",

    "content": "The trial of Sam Bankman-Fried is likely to be more consequential than just whether the man himself is found guilty. Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d diverting customers\u2019 funds to Alameda.\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\n\u201cReally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III \u2014 you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried\u2019s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried\u2019s conduct as \u201creally just old-fashioned embezzlement.\u201d\n\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried\u2019s statements that FTX was \u201cavoiding or managing conflicts of interest\u201d and that \u201cas a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms\u201d were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\n\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX\u2019s code that \u201cpermitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,\u201d which were created at Bankman-Fried\u2019s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried\u2019s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\n\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely \u2014 and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn\u2019t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that \u201cI honestly think it\u2019s negative EV [this may mean \u201cexpected value,\u201d as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n\n\u201cWhat was he saying to his parents and his other advisors about this?\u201d LaVigne says. \u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nTo further establish intent, the government can use Bankman-Fried\u2019s own words. The indictment calls Bankman-Fried\u2019s tweets in November 2022 \u201cfalse and misleading.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had him going out directly to the internet,\u201d LaVigne says. If he wrote things on Twitter or said things in interviews that weren\u2019t true, that\u2019s more fodder for the government\u2019s case. \u201cThey can point to that and say, \u2018This is what he said, this is what actually happened.\u2019\u201d\n\nOther evidence may include Signal messages and testimony from co-conspirators who plead guilty to their own charges. Alameda Research CEO Caroline Ellison, who was also sometimes Bankman-Fried\u2019s girlfriend, may play an important role \u2014 Bankman-Fried leaked her diaries to The New York Times and was consequently jailed for witness tampering. The government has indicated FTX co-founder Gary Wang and engineering head Nishad Singh will also be among the witnesses called to give testimony about Bankman-Fried.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him\n\nThere may be testimony from lenders, venture capitalists, and customers in order to establish the basis for some charges. In the indictment, the prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried lied to FTX investors. Some of those investors may be called on to testify, which is not the kind of thing VC big shots generally enjoy \u2014 and which might create collateral damage for the industry.\n\nIf, for instance, Sequoia Capital did due diligence around its investment in FTX, whatever Bankman-Fried told its partners could be important. Was FTX already sending Alameda customer funds at that point? Did Bankman-Fried know about it? And did he tell VCs at the time? (If he told them it wasn\u2019t happening, that would establish intent.) Binance was also an early investor in FTX, and former executives may be called on to testify as well, says Hermine Wong, the former head of policy at Coinbase and a former SEC regulator.\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s defense can also introduce risks for people who dealt with him. Defense lawyers have several simultaneous objectives. First and foremost, they\u2019re trying to prove their client is not guilty. But just in case they don\u2019t get the outcome they want, they\u2019re also laying the groundwork for appeals and sentencing arguments. Any piece of evidence they want to introduce for those two purposes has to come into play in the trial.\n\nAlready, Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyers are marking arguments that his constitutional rights are being violated by his pretrial incarceration because, among other things, his internet connection wasn\u2019t good enough for him to plan his defense, notes LaVigne. That could be grounds for an appeal.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried\u2019s behavior after the fall of FTX suggests he\u2019s something of a wild card. He may suggest he was acting on the advice of his lawyers. But he may also introduce other evidence that could be troublesome \u2014 implying, for instance, that he was engaged in standard industry behavior or that everything that happened was Binance\u2019s fault. That may be risky, but we already know that Bankman-Fried loves risk.\n\n\u201cIs he going to throw the entire industry under the bus?\u201d Wong asks. \u201cAn idea like, \u2018Everyone was doing this, it\u2019s not fair I\u2019m the only one who was charged?\u2019\u201d That may not fly in a court of law, but it could absolutely damage public perception of crypto at large.\n\nFor instance, just before he was arrested, Bankman-Fried brought forward messages from a crypto group chat in testimony he planned to give before Congress. In that testimony, he primarily blames Binance and his lawyers at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\nIt\u2019s possible other messages from group chats may be brought into evidence during the trial. That can potentially be embarrassing for the whole industry, Wong says.\n\n\u201cYou can imagine some of these founders, CEOs, people of that echelon talk to each other somewhat informally about what\u2019s going on,\u201d she says. If it seems like his peer group supported him, or worse, fawned over him, that\u2019s a real problem for the industry\u2019s reputation.\u201d\n\nAfter FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried went on an extensive media tour, doing interviews with The New York Times\u2019 Andrew Ross Sorkin and Good Morning America. Even under house arrest, he did interviews, including with The New Yorker. Bankman-Fried seemed to think that if he just explained things, everyone would understand that what he did was a mistake, not a crime.",

    "content": "Google CEO Sundar Pichai testified Monday in the U.S. government\u2019s antitrust trial against the company. The executive defended Google\u2019s business tactics, including its deal with Apple and other partners to make Google the default search engine.\n\nThe lawsuit stems from a 2020 antitrust claim over Google\u2019s dominance in the online search market. The claim is separate from one filed in January by the Department of Justice, along with eight states including New York, California and Colorado, that aims to \u201chalt Google\u2019s anticompetitive scheme, unwind Google\u2019s monopolistic grip on the market and restore competition to digital advertising.\u201d\n\nThe government has argued that Google uses its platforms and deals with partners to block out any competition in search or advertising, thus hindering competitors from accessing the data they\u2019d need to improve their products.\n\nGoogle argues that it\u2019s just doing business. Everybody wants Google as the default engine because it\u2019s the best. That doesn\u2019t make its actions illegal, the company says.\n\nMonday\u2019s trial hearing revealed plenty of juicy tidbits, including the $26.3 billion Google spent making itself the default search engine across platforms in 2021, how Google tried to take it further and have Chrome preinstalled on iPhones and more.\n\nGoogle paid $26 billion in 2021 to be everyone\u2019s default search engine\n\nWhen Google\u2019s search head Prabhakar Raghavan testified in court on October 28, he revealed that the tech giant had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 to multiple browsers, phones and platforms, from companies including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, The Verge reports.\n\nAbout $18 billion of that total amount went directly to Apple, according to a New York Times report published earlier this month. Google has had its deal with Apple in place since 2003.\n\nWhen questioned on the amount of money Google spends to get first pick of search engines, Pichai said that the decision was made with the consumer in mind. Google pays big bucks to be everywhere so that it can take in all the data and be the best search engine across different companies\u2019 devices, said Pichai, according to The Verge.\n\nGoogle understood the value of defaults very early on. U.S. Justice Department lawyer Meagan Bellshaw showed Pichai a 2007 email from a Google product strategy meeting containing data showing that when people changed their browser homepage to Google, they did 15% more Google searches. When they switched away, their Google searches dropped 27%.\n\n\u201cNitin argues that focusing on homepage market share is one of the most effective things we can do to make gains in search market share,\u201d read an email that summarized the meeting and was sent to Pichai, as well as other Google leaders, according to The Verge.\n\nThe amount that Google spent on homepage market share has been a fixing point in the trial. Earlier this month, the CEOs of Microsoft and DuckDuckGo testified that their search engines would have been far more successful, even competitive with Google, had they been able to make similar deals with Apple. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even said he was willing to spend $15 billion per year to get Bing into Apple\u2019s default search, per The Information.\n\nGoogle agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users\n\nAs part of its search deal with Apple, Google agreed not to promote Chrome to Safari users, reports Bloomberg. Google would have been able to do this with banners, pop-ups and other annoying means in other Google apps.\n\nThe agreement also meant that Apple never switched to a Google competitor or allowed users to choose their browser when setting up their iPhones.\n\nGoogle tried to be preinstalled on iPhones\n\nPichai admitted to attempting to get Tim Cook to preinstall Google on every iOS device back in 2018, according to The Verge. He hoped to make Google and Apple\u2019s services so connected as to be inseparable.\n\nThe way Pichai pitched it would have been a win-win for both companies. Google gets more people searching on its platform \u2014 not to mention all that juicy data \u2014 and Apple would get more revenue, as a result of the lucrative search agreement the two signed.\n\nFor whatever reason, Cook didn\u2019t take the bait. Apple doesn\u2019t preload third-party software onto its devices, and it wasn\u2019t going to make an exception for Google.\n\nGoogle\u2019s deleted chat logs\n\nDuring Pichai\u2019s testimony, the DOJ touched on Google\u2019s policy of deleting internal chat messages, despite being subject to a litigation hold. In February, the DOJ accused Google of systematically destroying chats through its history-off option, which deletes messages every 24 hours unless a user manually changed the setting.\n\nPichai said that he took action against the history-off default for chat in February to comply with the DOJ\u2019s litigation hold, according to CNBC.\n\nBellshaw pulled up a message exchange in 2021 where Pichai asked for history to be turned off in a group chat. Pichai responded that he wanted to discuss a personnel matter and the subject had nothing to do with the litigation hold, which he said he takes great care to comply with.\n\nA moment of nostalgia for Internet Explorer\n\nCast your memories back to 2005, when Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer became the default search engine. Back then, Google\u2019s legal chief David Drummond sent Microsoft an angry letter, saying that making Internet Explorer the search default was anticompetitive. Oh, how the tables have turned.\n\nAfter establishing that Google understands the inherent value of defaults, Bellshaw brought up Drummond\u2019s letter to establish the hypocrisy of Google today. The letter declared that problems with a default setting are made worse by how changes to defaults are handled, and that most end users \u201cdo not change defaults.\u201d\n\nThese are exactly the arguments that other search engine companies, like DuckDuckGo, Brave or Microsoft\u2019s Bing, make when they accuse Google of being anticompetitive by making deals with Apple and others. The DOJ doubled down on this, saying Google has become the monopoly it denounced years ago.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe case is expected to continue for several weeks, bringing to a head one of the biggest fights in tech antitrust since the U.S. took Microsoft to trial in the 1990s.\n\nIf the judge rules against Google, the outcome could look a lot like the Microsoft deal, in which the computer company was required to change its behavior and share its APIs with third-party developers. Microsoft was also banned from making anticompetitive and exclusive deals with computer manufacturers.\n\nGoogle might end up having to turn over all or most of the data it has collected to other search engines so they can improve their products and attract more users. The DOJ has said that Google gets 16 times more data than Bing does everyday.\n\nThe Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases.

    "content": "LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. \u2014 The Buffalo Bills have a new safety this season.\n\nHe sometimes plays close to the line of scrimmage, even lining up in the gaps and banging helmets with interior linemen. They use him as a hybrid linebacker in a three-safety dime package. He has played free safety, strong safety, outside cornerback, inside cornerback, left linebacker and right linebacker. And more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysically and mentally, he is being challenged, but he\u2019s grateful, content and all in.\n\nThe Bills\u2019 new safety is Jordan Poyer. It\u2019s the same Jordan Poyer who played for the team the previous six seasons, the only player in the NFL to have 500 or more tackles, 20 or more interceptions and 10 or more sacks in that time frame, a Bills captain for the fourth time, an Ed Block Courage Award winner in 2017, a Pro Bowl safety last year and an All-Pro the year before.\n\nBut this is a new Jordan Poyer because of ayahuasca.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, NFL team facilities were closed because of COVID-19, so Bills defenders met in Washington, D.C., for a few days to train, study and bond.\n\nThe first evening, cornerback Josh Norman welcomed the players to his home, and out came the shots of tequila. When Poyer was handed a shot, he looked at it and then at his teammates.\n\nHe put it down.\n\nNorman and the others, who had never seen him turn down a drink, were taken aback.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d one said. \u201cCome on, Deejay Poyo!\u201d\n\nDeejay Poyo was Poyer\u2019s alter ego. Inspired by tequila and a turntable, Poyer became someone else. And for Poyer, there was value in being someone else.\n\nWhat his teammates didn\u2019t know was that Poyer had not put alcohol to his lips in about three months, since he downed a shot of tequila on March 13 in the Puerto Vallarta airport bar during a 12-hour flight delay.\n\nPoyer spent his childhood in Astoria, Ore., a picturesque town on the mouth of the Columbia River not far from the Pacific Ocean. His mother and stepfather worked at a juvenile detention center and raised him with a strict hand. When he was no longer under their watch, unsupervised as a freshman at Oregon State, Poyer drank. And drank and drank.\n\nIt never seemed to affect his play in college, where he was a consensus All-American. And despite his continued drinking, he made steady progress in his early NFL years.\n\nGO DEEPER Graham: Bills rally around Sean McDermott in another win over Chiefs\n\nIn his third season, when he was an emerging starter with the Cleveland Browns, he DM\u2019d an Instagram model after she liked one of his posts on Twitter. She was a freshman at Florida Atlantic, a small-town girl from the Adirondacks who knew nothing about football but thought Poyer was cute. He traveled to Florida to meet her, and before the weekend was over, Poyer declared, \u201cI\u2019m going to marry this girl.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoyer made numerous trips to Florida that offseason. That spring as Rachel Bush was finishing her freshman year of college, she learned she was pregnant. After their daughter, Aliyah, was born, Poyer signed with the Bills, and the family moved to Buffalo. He and Rachel married in 2018.\n\nHis drinking was out of control by then. He would down a six-pack of IPAs in 20 to 30 minutes for a quick buzz. Blacking out was a regular occurrence. His behavior tested his marriage, but there was a draw between him and Rachel like a north pole to south.\n\nAfter the Bills lost to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the 2019 playoffs, Poyer was crestfallen. He says he drank heavily every day for five weeks. At one point Rachel rid their home of all alcohol, but he would still sneak what he could.\n\nRachel says her husband hid alcohol from her beneath bathroom cabinets and other places \u201clike a child.\u201d\n\nHe was close to losing her.\n\nThe drinking, he realized, was an attempt to relieve stress \u2014 stress from football expectations and stress from family life. He was a worrier, except with a drink in his hand.\n\nPoyer went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Then another, and another.\n\nThe get-together at Norman\u2019s house was his first significant temptation.\n\n\u201cWhen I put that drink down for the first time, it was almost like I overcame a demon,\u201d Poyer says.\n\nThe more time that passed, the less Poyer wanted to drink. He has no desire for it now, and the smell of alcohol almost makes him gag.\n\nDespite a stellar career and a loving family, Bills safety Jordan Poyer \u201cfelt like there was something missing\u201d as recently as last year. (Dan Pompei / The Athletic)\n\nBeing sober didn\u2019t make him immune to anxiety and depression, however. In the 2022 season, he missed five games with elbow, foot, knee and rib injuries. When the Bills lost to the Bengals in the divisional playoff round, Poyer felt responsible for not doing more.\n\nAnd his angst ran deeper than football.\n\n\u201cI still felt like there was something missing because I have this beautiful house, a beautiful family, everything anyone could ask for,\u201d he says. \u201cI still felt a sense of unhappiness, a sense of not understanding who I was, and why I was the way I was. A part of me felt guilty just because I was living this way.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPoyer couldn\u2019t come to terms with why, despite all his shortcomings, he was in such an enviable position. His football journey was improbable. No major college wanted him until Oregon State came in with a late offer to grayshirt, meaning his scholarship wouldn\u2019t begin until January of his freshman year. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 2013 NFL draft, came into the league as a cornerback, was cut six games into his rookie season and then had to learn a new position with a new team. He took a blind-side hit that put him in the hospital for two days with a lacerated kidney and a concussion. His career could have been over then.\n\nYet by now he has outlasted 191 of the 217 players drafted ahead of him. And he hasn\u2019t just survived in the NFL \u2014 he has thrived.\n\nWhat had he done to deserve this?\n\nWas he justifying his good fortune?\n\nWould there be a greater purpose?\n\nIn 2018, Poyer saw a therapist for anxiety once a week. It was unfulfilling.\n\nThe answers were somewhere else.\n\nGO DEEPER NFL Week 14 takeaways: Bills playoff bound? How far can Joe Flacco take the Browns?\n\nIn the Quechua language, ayahuasca (pronounced \u2018eye-ah-WAH-ska\u2019) means \u201cvine of the soul.\u201d\n\nAyahuasca is a psychedelic drug made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub and the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It has been used for more than a thousand years by Amazonian tribes. Ingesting it can induce a dreamlike feeling, an altered state of consciousness, mystical experiences and euphoria.\n\nIn the summer of 2022, Aaron Rodgers revealed he had taken ayahuasca and credited it with helping him have two of the best seasons of his career for the Packers.\n\nPoyer had never heard of ayahuasca at the time. \u201cMy first thought was eff that,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cYou crazy? I\u2019m not doing that.\u201d\n\nThe funny word kept showing up in different conversations on his social media feeds and podcasts. Poyer researched it and became intrigued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter the difficult 2022 season, Rachel suggested Poyer take a \u201cguys trip\u201d after the season to check out. But \u201cguys trips\u201d usually involve alcohol, and he didn\u2019t want that. Sightseeing isn\u2019t his thing. \u201cWhat I really wanted to do was work on trying to be a better me,\u201d he says.\n\nHe discovered Resonance, a retreat center in Costa Rica on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific coast and the cloud forest of Monteverde.\n\nTo prepare his mind to enter a state of awareness, he was to eat only chicken, fish and salad for one month, with no oils and sugar added. Then he had to cut out chicken and fish for the week preceding the ceremony. He also was told to practice yoga and breathing exercises that would be useful if he experienced anxiety during the three ceremonies spread over a week.\n\nIn a tiki hut in a wooded, secluded area, a shaman presented each participant with a cup of ayahuasca brew, which is kind of like tea, but with benefits. Taste is not one of them. Poyer says ayahuasca tastes like earth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s brownish and really thick,\u201d he says. \u201cIt almost looks like oil, but it\u2019s darker and thicker. It\u2019s one of the worst things you could ever taste.\u201d\n\nFor the first hour after swigging it down, he lay in a bean bag chair in silence, setting intentions. Poyer\u2019s intentions were to understand himself better and love better. Eventually, the shaman provided a second cup, and then, enchantment.\n\n\u201cAt first what it felt like was my soul left my body for a good two minutes,\u201d Poyer says.\n\nInitially, it was unsettling.\n\n\u201cPeople try to control it, but you can\u2019t,\u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt took me about five or 10 minutes to figure it out. The ego has to die so the medicine can work. In order to let go and let the medicine do what it\u2019s supposed to do, we have to just breathe.\u201d\n\nFor about the next hour, Poyer says the highest version of himself lectured him out loud. It was, in his word, \u201ccrazy.\u201d First, highest-version Poyer addressed his desire to understand himself better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe was basically saying, \u2018Jordan, look at your life, bro \u2014 what are you mad at?\u2019 \u201d Poyer says. \u201cIt was what I needed to hear because I wasn\u2019t appreciating anything \u2014 not my wife, my daughter, my family, my house. It was all about me and what I wanted.\u201d\n\nThen he turned to loving better. It was, he says, as if a Pandora\u2019s box opened on how to love.\n\nThe remainder of the ceremonies, which lasted nine hours each, were about curiosity, energy and connectedness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about how to be a good human,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it grounds you. Really grounds you.\u201d\n\nJordan Poyer is the Bills\u2019 second-leading tackler but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like for a defense plagued by injuries. (Sarah Stier / Getty Images)\n\nTwo days before OTAs began last April, Poyer returned to the Bills\u2019 headquarters and stepped on the scale. The needle settled at 179 pounds, about 20 pounds below his playing weight.\n\nAfter resuming his regular routine, the weight came back quickly.\n\nHe discussed his experience with curious teammates, coaches and the team psychologist. Poyer hoped ayahuasca would elevate his football performances as Rodgers believes it did his, but it hasn\u2019t worked that way for him.\n\nHe is the second-leading tackler on his team but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like. What he has done, according to former Bills defensive coordinator Les Frazier, now an analyst for NFL Network, is enable his defense to be the best it can by lifting others through versatility, sacrifice, toughness and communication. Poyer wears his \u201cC\u201d well.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m playing OK this year,\u201d Poyer said during the Bills\u2019 bye week on the patio of his Florida home. \u201cI\u2019m not playing the best that I\u2019ve played in my career. There are probably two plays I really want back. But I\u2019m doing a lot. And in a very deep sense, I absolutely love that I\u2019m entrusted with doing as much as I\u2019m doing on this defense.\u201d\n\nAyahuasca gifted him in another way \u2014 with perspective.\n\nEgo is a powerful force in professional athletes. It helps them ascend and often hastens their downfalls. In previous seasons, Poyer believes his responses to successes and failures were too ego-driven. Football was him \u2014 he has an NFL logo tattooed on his left shoulder \u2014 and he was football.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNot anymore.\n\n\u201cWe still have games left that I\u2019m excited about, but I knew some way, somehow, this universe was going to test me this year,\u201d he says. \u201cWe lost DaQuan Jones, Matt Milano and Tre\u2019Davious White for the season. It\u2019s hard. This s\u2014 is hard. And it\u2019s not just (the losses). I\u2019m 32, not this young spring chicken anymore. You know, s\u2014 hurts all the time. But my perspective is I get to play a game that I love, and I\u2019m healthy enough to play. Every time you come out of a game, that\u2019s a win in its own way.\u201d\n\nGO DEEPER Bills training camp preview: Is 2023 final run for Micah Hyde-Jordan Poyer tandem?\n\nPoyer\u2019s commitment is such that last season, when a rib injury precluded him from airplane travel, he took a 32-hour round-trip drive to play in a game in Kansas City. He wants to lift a Lombardi Trophy badly, as much as ever. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, he believes he can handle the disappointment better.\n\nOn Fridays this season, Poyer, fellow safety Taylor Rapp and assistant strength coach Will Greenberg play crystal bowls at Bills headquarters. \u201cThe different tones that you can tune into can enhance chakras within you and help you heal,\u201d he says.\n\nHealing takes many forms.\n\nWhen Poyer was 12, Louis Dunbar, who has done multiple stints in prison for violent crimes, called him for the first time and stunned him with the revelation he was his biological father. In subsequent conversations, Dunbar often said he wanted to see him or come to one of his games. He never has.\n\n\u201cI always had this hate and resentment toward him I was holding,\u201d says Poyer, who doesn\u2019t know where Dunbar is. \u201cThis experience enabled me to let that go. I realize I wouldn\u2019t have anything \u2014 my daughter and my wife \u2014 if not for him. Even if it was just the seed he gave my mom. So someday I\u2019ll meet him, give him a hug and tell him I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nRachel has no interest in taking ayahuasca. But she is grateful her husband discovered it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAfter he did ayahuasca, he became like my dream husband,\u201d Rachel says. \u201cI was nervous about what it would do to him, but he came back a totally new man, so appreciative of me and our family.\u201d\n\nBills safety Jordan Poyer with his wife, Rachel, and their daughter, Aliyah. (Courtesy of Rachel Bush Poyer)\n\nHighest-version Poyer made Poyer aware he was not doing the little things \u2014 waking up with a smile, giving Rachel a hug on his way out, or being present even when his attention could be divided.\n\nPoyer has turned off his DMs on Instagram and deleted his Twitter/X account. Instagram features a For You page \u2014 a personalized feed based on user engagement patterns. In the past, Poyer\u2019s was filled with posts of other girls, according to Rachel. Now there\u2019s nothing on Poyer\u2019s For You page except football and ayahuasca. She knows because they have one another\u2019s passwords.\n\n\u201cHis attention now is 100 percent on me, his family and his career,\u201d says Rachel, who has more than 4 million Instagram followers, an OnlyFans page and a line of skincare products.\n\nSome players feel more pressure when the end is closer than the beginning. The Bills have an out in Poyer\u2019s contract after this season. He isn\u2019t stressing about any of it. His focus is here and now.\n\nPoyer has thought about becoming a football commentator after retirement. But he has more to offer than sports talk. He could talk about why he\u2019s never had a vaccine, why Aliyah is homeschooled, or how he believes God transcends religions.\n\nHe could discuss why he has always thought he might be an alien. \u201cI truly feel like I\u2019m not from this planet, always being the odd one out, having different perspectives, thinking differently,\u201d says Poyer, who is fascinated by stars.\n\nPoyer has what philosophers call epistemic humility \u2014 he believes knowledge is limited and filtered by personal experiences. And now he is beginning to solve the mysteries of his existence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMy life has been changed forever,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd my purpose is to be a bright light for everybody that I touch and connect with.\u201d\n\nIn March, Poyer will return to Resonance for another retreat. Also planning to go are his cousin who went with him last year, and some first-timers \u2014 his mother, brother, a couple of friends and possibly a couple of teammates. He will be working on a documentary about ayahuasca.\n\nA handpan is a steel musical instrument that generates sound through vibrations. Sound healers and meditators often play the handpan. In Costa Rica, Poyer heard one for the first time and was drawn to it. Now he plays his frequently.\n\nNot long ago, Rachel returned home at about 10 p.m. and was tidying up the kitchen when, in the peace of the night, she heard something coming from the outside balcony upstairs \u2014 ethereal, haunting sounds.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of like something you would hear in a dream,\u201d Rachel says.\n\nIt was music the old Jordan Poyer never could have made.\n\n(Photo: Cooper Neill / Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe Football 100,\u201d the definitive ranking of the NFL\u2019s best 100 players of all time, is on sale now.

    "content": "ChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was \u201cnot consistently candid in his communications\u201d with the board of directors.\n\n\u201cThe board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,\u201d the artificial intelligence company said in a statement.\n\nIn the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley\u2019s sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry\u2019s future.\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI\u2019s chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately, the company said, while it searches for a permanent replacement.\n\nThe announcement also said another OpenAI co-founder and top executive, Greg Brockman, the board\u2019s chairman, would step down from that role but remain at the company, where he serves as president. But later on X, formerly Twitter, Brockman posted a message he sent to OpenAI employees in which he wrote, \u201cbased on today\u2019s news, i quit.\u201d\n\nIn another X post on Friday night, Brockman said Altman was asked to join a video meeting at noon Friday with the company\u2019s board members, minus Brockman, during which OpenAI co-founder and Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever informed Altman he was being fired.\n\n\u201cSam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did today,\u201d Brockman wrote, adding that he was informed of his removal from the board in a separate call with Sutskever a short time later.\n\nOpenAI declined to answer questions on what Altman\u2019s alleged lack of candor was about. The statement said his behavior was hindering the board\u2019s ability to exercise its responsibilities.\n\nAltman posted Friday on X: \u201ci loved my time at openai. it was transformative for me personally, and hopefully the world a little bit. most of all i loved working with such talented people. will have more to say about what\u2019s next later.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement allowing OpenAI access to part of the AP\u2019s text archives.\n\nAltman helped start OpenAI as a nonprofit research laboratory in 2015. But it was ChatGPT\u2019s explosion into public consciousness that thrust Altman into the spotlight as a face of generative AI \u2014 technology that can produce novel imagery, passages of text and other media. On a world tour this year, he was mobbed by a crowd of adoring fans at an event in London.\n\nHe\u2019s sat with multiple heads of state to discuss AI\u2019s potential and perils. Just Thursday, he took part in a CEO summit at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in San Francisco, where OpenAI is based.\n\nHe predicted AI will prove to be \u201cthe greatest leap forward of any of the big technological revolutions we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d He also acknowledged the need for guardrails, calling attention to the existential dangers future AI could pose.\n\nSome computer scientists have criticized that focus on far-off risks as distracting from the real-world limitations and harms of current AI products. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has launched an investigation into whether OpenAI violated consumer protection laws by scraping public data and publishing false information through its chatbot.\n\nThe company said its board consists of OpenAI\u2019s chief scientist, Ilya Sutskever, and three non-employees: Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, tech entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and Helen Toner of the Georgetown Center for Security and Emerging Technology.\n\nOpenAI\u2019s key business partner, Microsoft, which has invested billions of dollars into the startup and helped provide the computing power to run its AI systems, said that the transition won\u2019t affect its relationship.\n\n\u201cWe have a long-term partnership with OpenAI and Microsoft remains committed to Mira and their team as we bring this next era of AI to our customers,\u201d said an emailed Microsoft statement.\n\nWhile not trained as an AI engineer, Altman, now 38, has been seen as a Silicon Valley wunderkind since his early 20s. He was recruited in 2014 to take lead of the startup incubator YCombinator.\n\n\u201cSam is one of the smartest people I know, and understands startups better than perhaps anyone I know, including myself,\u201d read YCombinator co-founder Paul Graham\u2019s 2014 announcement that Altman would become its president. Graham said at the time that Altman was \u201cone of those rare people who manage to be both fearsomely effective and yet fundamentally benevolent.\u201d\n\nOpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to \u201cadvance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.\u201d\n\nThat changed in 2018 when it incorporated a for-profit business Open AI LP, and shifted nearly all its staff into the business, not long after releasing its first generation of the GPT large language model for mimicking human writing. Around the same time, Musk, who had co-chaired its board with Altman, resigned from the board in a move that OpenAI said would eliminate a \u201cpotential future conflict for Elon\u201d due to Tesla\u2019s work on building self-driving systems.\n\nWhile OpenAI\u2019s board has preserved its nonprofit governance structure, the startup it oversees has increasingly sought to capitalize on its technology by tailoring its popular chatbot to business customers.\n\nAt its first developer conference last week, Altman was the main speaker showcasing a vision for a future of AI agents that could help people with a variety of tasks. Days later, he announced the company would have to pause new subscriptions to its premium version of ChatGPT because it had exceeded capacity.\n\nAltman\u2019s exit \u201cis indeed shocking as he has been the face of\u201d generative AI technology, said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran.\n\nHe said OpenAI still has a \u201cdeep bench of technical leaders\u201d but its next executives will have to steer it through the challenges of scaling the business and meeting the expectations of regulators and society.\n\nForrester analyst Rowan Curran speculated that Altman\u2019s departure, \u201cwhile sudden,\u201d did not likely reflect deeper business problems.\n\n\u201cThis seems to be a case of an executive transition that was about issues with the individual in question, and not with the underlying technology or business,\u201d Curran said.\n\nAltman has a number of possible next steps. Even while running OpenAI, he placed large bets on several other ambitious projects.\n\nAmong them are Helion Energy, for developing fusion reactors that could produce prodigious amounts of energy from the hydrogen in seawater, and Retro Biosciences, which aims to add 10 years to the human lifespan using biotechnology. Altman also co-founded Worldcoin, a biometric and cryptocurrency project that\u2019s been scanning people\u2019s eyeballs with the goal of creating a vast digital identity and financial network.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press business writers Haleluya Hadero in New York, Kelvin Chan in London and Michael Liedtke and David Hamilton in San Francisco contributed to this report.",

    "content": "In perhaps the most unexpected tech news of the year, billionaire and AI evangelist Sam Altman has been ejected from his CEO role at OpenAI by the company\u2019s board after an apparent vote of no confidence. Its exact wording in a release issued this afternoon: Altman\u2019s \u201cdeparture follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d\n\nWhat the hell is happening at the most hyped company in the world?! Here are some totally speculative theories that occurred to us and others around the web.\n\n1. Did Altman circumvent the board in a major deal?\n\nBased on the board\u2019s language and the way these giant tech companies work, this is the prevailing theory floating around right now. \u201cNot consistently candid\u201d is a very diplomatic way of saying Altman lied.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Altman \u2014 and potentially OpenAI President Greg Brockman, who stepped down as chairman simultaneously, then resigned \u2014 wanted to make a bold move that he knew the board would not like. It\u2019s not uncommon for these deals to be hammered out quietly in smoke- (or vape-) filled rooms and then presented as a fait accompli, but if it was controversial enough and the board found out about these maneuvers, it could be fuel for an ouster.\n\nBut what kind of deal would be big and dangerous enough for a summary dismissal of the CEO and famous face of the company? The man was onstage two weeks ago; I just talked with him! What could have happened since then?\n\nFew would be shocked if Microsoft, which is deeply, deeply embedded in OpenAI as an investor and customer, is a factor here. Could Altman have been working with \u2014 or against \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s patron in secret? If Altman wanted to kill the golden goose by going independent, that might have activated the board\u2019s fiduciary or otherwise statutory duty. On the other hand, if he was negotiating some other deal, like an acquisition or deeper and more exclusive integration, it could also have caused the board to bristle, either at the idea itself or at being excluded.\n\nBut if Microsoft was as shocked as the rest of us, as one report has it, it could hardly be the kind of high-stakes conspiracy some seem to be hoping for. But one must assume that Microsoft would say that either way. Even if they\u2019d been working with Altman on some kind of secret plan, they can truthfully say they were surprised by his firing. (And they \u201cremain committed to our partnership.\u201d)\n\n2. Do they disagree on long-term strategy?\n\nDespite being the hottest tech company in the world right now and everyone talking about ChatGPT, OpenAI isn\u2019t exactly a sound business. It\u2019s shoveling money into the furnace as fast as it can by serving, by all accounts, a fantastically expensive product at bargain-bin prices.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good for a year or two, but at some point that strategy changes from a growth hack to an existential liability. Could Altman and the board have had irreconcilable differences on where that point lies?\n\nThis doesn\u2019t seem so likely. The company has been very deliberately pursuing this very publicly, confidently and on a long-term basis. Altman and the board seem to be in sync on this, at least for the present.\n\n3. Do the numbers not add up?\n\nOn the other hand, could OpenAI be losing even more money than Altman admitted or projected? It seems impossible, but the costs of running this operation have no precedent, nor really does the operation itself.\n\nOr what if, and again this is purely speculation, Altman has been secretly pursuing an internal project, perhaps at significant cost, against the advice of the board and without the necessary safety measures that probably should accompany such research? It sounds a little wild, but firing your CEO like this is also a little wild.\n\nSome kind of major mismatch in the financial department could be cause for dismissal, but it\u2019s hard to imagine what Altman could have kept from the board and CTO that would be so damning.\n\nThere\u2019s also the possibility that Altman was making personal investments in a way that the board disagreed with. With OpenAI poised to be a kingmaker in the field, he would certainly be in a position of power. One would think that, as an ideologically driven person already rich beyond belief and at the head of the world\u2019s leading AI company, Altman would have risen beyond having to do this kind of side deal, or at the very least that scrutiny on him and those close to him would prevent them. But one can never be sure.\n\n4. Could it be a major security or privacy incident?\n\nThe idea that the company has experienced a major, perhaps pervasive, security issue is bolstered by the fact that Microsoft reportedly suspended use of ChatGPT internally a few days ago. OpenAI subsequently stopped allowing new signups. If there was a serious security problem in its biggest product and Altman downplayed it, that would obviously create distrust with the board.\n\nThere is also the potential for misuse at scale with the enormous amount of personal data that travels through OpenAI\u2019s APIs and services.\n\nWorking against this theory is the fact that CTO Mira Murati was just elevated to interim CEO in Altman\u2019s place. It seems unlikely that anything security-related would go through the CEO and not the CTO, or that the two would be at odds to the point where one could be fired like this and the other swapped in to clean up the mess. As the board\u2019s statement notes, Murati is in charge of product and safety, among other things. Any significant snafu in that department would reflect on her, as well as Altman.\n\n5. Perhaps a difference of AI ethics or philosophy?\n\nAltman is a proud techno-optimist, and often speaks fondly of the possibilities of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, a theoretical software system that achieves human-like intellect and versatility.\n\nThe board\u2019s statement pointedly includes that \u201cOpenAI was deliberately structured to advance our mission: to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all humanity\u201d and that new leadership was necessary. It\u2019s possible that Sam\u2019s zeal for AGI, even absent a secret project or agreement, led to a major rift between him and the board.\n\nIt\u2019s been obvious to all that Altman took the company in a much more corporate direction from its origins, changing its legal status and aggressively pursuing enterprise and consumer applications. That doesn\u2019t sound a lot like the \u201cmission\u201d the board wants to advance. Then again, this shift didn\u2019t happen today, and it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like a plausible reason for abruptly firing the CEO and a few others on a beautiful fall Friday afternoon.\n\n6. What about IP and legal liability?\n\nAltman told me at OpenAI\u2019s Dev Day earlier this month that the company doesn\u2019t want to incur any copyright problems by using (as I had asked about) datasets of pirated books. But a lot of research I\u2019ve been reading contradicts that, as does pretty much every AI data scientist I talk to. It\u2019s exceedingly hard to imagine that OpenAI built GPT-3 with the copyrighted books database (as seems to be the case) but not GPT-4 or succeeding models. (I was going to write this up next week, so thanks OpenAI board for eating my lunch.)\n\nIf you were the board and facing the mounting accusations that your product was built on a dataset that includes thousands or millions of copyrighted works \u2014 and your CEO had systematically downplayed the potential liability there \u2014 how would you feel? I\u2019d feel very hurt.\n\nBut again, if copyright liability was the reason, it seems unlikely that the board would promote the CTO. Presumably, OpenAI\u2019s Chief Science Officer Ilya Sutskever would also have been in the know, and he\u2019s still on the board.\n\n7. Did CTO Mira Murati launch a coup?\n\nProbably not \u2014 she seems cool, and anyway what CTO wants to be CEO? Mira, answer my email!\n\n8. Was it a \u201cpersonal matter\u201d?\n\nWhen someone is kicked out in a hurry, it\u2019s not uncommon that there was some kind of unprofessional behavior in the workplace. Some CEOs get a pass on things like having kids with direct reports, but not all.\n\nAltman also has three siblings, and his younger sister Annie has publicly accused him of abuse. We have no way of evaluating these allegations, which involve private matters.\n\nOur read on the board\u2019s language in dismissing Altman, however, is that it was not a legal or personal problem that provoked the action, but a professional or business one.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t know the full truth on this for a long time, as the characters in the drama are likely to be NDA\u2019ed up. Per various whispers and leaks, an all-hands meeting about the situation this afternoon didn\u2019t produce any revelations beyond banal reassurances that the company is fine and they\u2019ll get a fresh CEO soon. Expect to hear a lot of rumors before we hear the real thing.",

    "content": "Twitch has had a tense year, in part due to community backlash over policy changes that affect the way creators can monetize their content.\n\nLast year, the company announced that it would end the 70/30 subscription revenue split deal that it had offered select streamers in favor of prioritizing ad revenue. In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don\u2019t count.\n\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. The higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 We\u2019re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program. To recognize deeper support from your community, Tier 1, 2, and 3 subs will earn you 1, 2, and 6 points respectively towards qualifying for the program. pic.twitter.com/HdOiLvg3qC \u2014 Twitch Support (@TwitchSupport) August 28, 2023\n\nTwitch also walked back its policy restricting embedded ads and other sponsored content, following fallout from streamers who depend on branded content as the bulk of their income.\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO Dan Clancy, who took over earlier this year, has prioritized engaging with Twitch streamers, and involving their perspectives in policy changes going forward. The company\u2019s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year\u2019s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year. New features and policy changes announced during the convention\u2019s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch\u2019s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\n\nTechCrunch: I\u2019m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization. Is there anything that Twitch is doing to appease irate creators?\n\nMike Minton: Two years ago, we said we\u2019re no longer gonna do these deals that weren\u2019t objective in terms of eligibility criteria. We ended that program. It affected a relatively small number of creators, but what it really impacted was the community going, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to work for.\u201d And that led to us recently announcing Partner Plus. There was some feedback saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to need a lot of subs,\u201d and we reacted to it by making it eligible by sub points so that your higher price point subscriptions cost more, and that was actually received quite positively.\n\nBoth Dan and I have said in different forms, that this is the beginning. It\u2019s not the end and we\u2019re going to continue to work to provide access to higher rev shares as we can over time, to more streamers.\n\nWhat would that look like?\n\nThe simple answer is now, 350 was the criteria we established, right? And that number is arbitrary and could easily come down. Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We\u2019re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they\u2019re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\n\nRight, and that decision to change the revenue split also came out of a decision to prioritize ad revenue. Creators and viewers have said that integrating ads in their streams is very frustrating. What kind of feedback is Twitch going to provide in response to that?\n\nLet\u2019s level set a couple things. So one of the things we knew with ads, if we\u2019re going to get streamers to buy into ads as a good way to monetize, is that we had to increase the rev share, which we did, and launch the ad incentive program.\n\nWe\u2019re helping streamers understand that with ad running, you have to think about it consistently over time in order to earn predictable revenue. It\u2019s a very reliable source of income for many streamers.\n\nSo I think the combination of making it easier to run, increasing the rev share and then recently in the keynote, we talked about two new features to allow moderators to know when an ad break is coming, and adjust the ad break around the content because the problem in livestreaming, as you\u2019re aware, is that people don\u2019t want to miss out. So we\u2019re very focused on improving the ad experience by allowing the ad breaks to be synchronized with the content and enrolling moderations and eventually the community in adjusting those ad breaks.\n\nLike you said, livestreaming is very different from static content, and tactics for monetization that work for Instagram or TikTok just don\u2019t really work for Twitch or any livestreaming platform. In those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\n\nOne thing we\u2019ve done since the beginning, where we are a leader, is getting people to take their wallets out and support creators through subscriptions, gifting, cheering. I think that sets us as a unique community-based platform where viewers are directly supporting creators in that way.\n\nOther services have tried it but from what I can tell them, what streamers have told me, is that Twitch is really the leader in that way. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on advertising, because there\u2019s no social media, content distribution service in the world that doesn\u2019t rely on advertising as a component. So ads have been a big focus.\n\nAnd the third piece, which is where we\u2019re behind, is sponsorships. We\u2019re now focused a lot on growing sponsorship opportunities for streamers and ensuring that we have three \u2014 based on what size you are, where you\u2019re located, how experienced you are, what type of content you\u2019re creating, where you\u2019re located in the world \u2014 three options to support you as a creator.\n\nI\u2019ve spoken to a lot of creators over the course of my career, and a common gripe seems to be that they can\u2019t subsist off of just subs and ad revenue. They have to have these branded partnerships that are difficult to land for midsize creators and smaller creators. What is Twitch doing specifically to diversify its branded partnership content?\n\nWe have this unique opportunity, being part of the third largest and fastest growing advertising business in the world, AKA Amazon. So what we\u2019re actively working on is, as advertisers that come in through Amazon advertising, that they understand the magic of Twitch, that they can easily set up influencer deals programmatically. And ultimately, you don\u2019t have the measurement that they expect.\n\nBut because of Amazon\u2019s diversity of advertisers, this is where before it was more focused on endemic advertisers, game publishers, et cetera. And now we\u2019re able to expand that reach to a much broader set of advertisers and serve the needs of both the affiliate marketing end of sponsorships, which is more of a performance model, as well as more of the top of the funnel, where you\u2019re looking for more brand awareness.\n\nObviously a lot of this discord among Twitch\u2019s community also comes at a time when other streaming platforms like YouTube or Kick are starting to take off, and enticing streamers with better revenue splits. A common complaint that I\u2019ve heard is that bigger streamers are going to be making money wherever they are, but smaller streamers who have less of an audience don\u2019t qualify for Partner Plus will get a better deal at YouTube or Kick than at Twitch. What is Twitch doing to keep those streamers?\n\nThere are a couple of things that I\u2019ll point out. One is acknowledging what Dan has done as the CEO to get out and engage with streamers, hear their concerns, and really influence our priorities as a company, is really a consequence of him both being an active streamer as well as being extremely engaged within the community.\n\nAnd then, more broadly for both Jeremy [Jeremy Forrester is VP of Community Product] and myself as the product leaders, building the product is continuing to innovate and ensure that we are absolutely a unique service. Whether that\u2019s features, like we\u2019re working on Stories, whether that\u2019s monetization \u2014 it\u2019s all in service of ensuring that livestreaming creators can be more successful on Twitch.\n\nFor a long time, there was a sort of exclusivity with Twitch, where there were exclusive deals, and simultaneous streaming on other platforms was forbidden. I have to wonder if those decisions to change these policies were in response to competition from other platforms.\n\nI would say it this way: I think they are an acknowledgement, and maybe a closer connectivity to the community via Dan specifically. I credit Dan in his short time as CEO to really make some big, hard decisions. Both the launch of Partner Plus, as well as simulcasting, the embed stuff we talked about in the keynote \u2014 these are three things that I think are very much an acknowledgement of the feedback from the community. We\u2019ve made that change, so I wouldn\u2019t call it out of competitive pressures. I would call it out of focus on the community.",

    "content": "Beeper Mini, the app bringing blue bubble iMessage texts to Android users, is back in operation on Monday after a long weekend that saw Apple putting an end to Beeper\u2019s services, claiming it was a security risk. Now, the startup behind the new app says it has resumed functioning, but hasn\u2019t disclosed how that\u2019s been made possible. In addition, Beeper Mini will be free for the time being given the unstable nature of Beeper\u2019s status and Apple\u2019s attempts at shutting it down.\n\nFounded by former Pebble smartwatch founder Eric Migicovsky, Beeper had originally been working on an app that aggregated all of a user\u2019s chat apps into a single interface. However, upon the discovery of new technology that allowed it to reverse-engineer the iMessage protocol, it set out to build a new app called Beeper Mini that solely focused on bringing iMessage chats to Android users for $1.99 per month. That included support for high-quality photos and videos, tapback reactions, typing indicators, read receipts and more.\n\nThe app quickly climbed into the top 20 in the Play Store\u2019s charts and saw over 100,000 downloads in its first 48 hours, the company claims.\n\nUnfortunately, Beeper Mini\u2019s success was short-lived. Only days after launching, Apple on Friday night took action against the startup, having found a way to stop Beeper Mini\u2019s messages from being passed from Android phones to its servers. The Cupertino tech giant explained that it needed to shut down the app because it \u201cposed significant risks to user security and privacy, including the potential for metadata exposure and enabling unwanted messages, spam, and phishing attacks.\u201d Essentially, Apple said that it couldn\u2019t verify that Beeper\u2019s claims of end-to-end encryption were true, and therefore it needed to take \u201csteps to protect our users by blocking techniques that exploit fake credentials in order to gain access to iMessage.\u201d\n\nAs the Beeper team scrambled for a fix, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) shamed Apple for its intervention in a post on X, formerly Twitter, saying \u201cGreen bubble texts are less secure. So why would Apple block a new app allowing Android users to chat with iPhone users on iMessage? Big Tech executives are protecting profits by squashing competitors. Chatting between different platforms should be easy and secure,\u201d she wrote.\n\nOn Monday, Beeper announced on its blog that it has updated the Beeper Mini app to fix the issue that \u201ccaused messages not to be sent or received.\u201d It hasn\u2019t said exactly how it\u2019s made that happen, but notes that the security of Beeper Mini remains unchanged \u2014 promising it still includes local, end-to-end encryption as previously described. Migicovsky told TechCrunch he can\u2019t share anything on that topic beyond what\u2019s already in the blog post.\n\nThough Beeper Mini is running again, there is a caveat: phone number registration isn\u2019t yet working. That means users will have to sign in with an Apple ID. The startup says it\u2019s working to address this too.\n\nIt has also decided to make Beeper Mini free for the time being, given how \u201cchaotic\u201d things have been over the past few days. \u201cAs soon as things stabilize (we hope they will), we\u2019ll look at turning on subscriptions again,\u201d the blog post reads.\n\nAlthough Beeper did not have its app reviewed by an independent third-party security firm before launch, it\u2019s challenging Apple to put it to the test.\n\n\u201cIf Apple doubts the security and privacy of our app, we\u2019re willing to share the entire Beeper Mini codebase with a mutually agreed upon 3rd party security research firm,\u201d the blog post stated. Asked if they would run an audit without Apple\u2019s participation, Migicovsky tells us he wants Apple to agree on the firm first. The company also said it would be willing to add a pager emoji to metadata on all its sent messages, which would allow the Messages app to filter out messages from Beeper Mini users.\n\nUsers can get the updated version of Beeper Mini from beeper.com/update on their phone for the time being as the company has not yet submitted the new version to the Play Store, claiming it needs to do some final testing. But that means users are being asked to sideload the app update onto their devices, which is riskier than downloading from the Play Store, where apps undergo reviews and basic security checks. The app update is now live on Google Play (updated, 1:28 pm ET).\n\nThe update, which now prompts users to sign in with their Apple ID, also includes new features, like chats that will open at the last unread message and an improved video player, the blog post noted. In tests, signing in with our Apple ID generated an Apple prompt that noted our ID was being used to sign in with a device \u201cnear Los Angeles, CA\u201d (where we are not located.) We received an error message \u201c2FA submission error\u201d after updating the app, but an uninstall/reinstall fixed this. We understand this is a known bug.\n\nAfter setting up the new Beeper Mini, a message appeared on our iPhone that said: \u201cDevice Added to Your Account. A Mac now has access to iMessage,\u201d which offers a hint as to Beeper\u2019s fix.\n\nApple has not yet gotten in touch directly with Beeper, having only released a statement to the press. It\u2019s unclear at this time if, how, or when it will be able to disable Beeper\u2019s updated build.",

    "content": "A judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.\n\nJudge Arthur Engoron, ruling in a civil lawsuit brought by New York\u2019s attorney general, found that the former president and his company deceived banks, insurers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his net worth on paperwork used in making deals and securing financing.\n\nEngoron ordered that some of Trump\u2019s business licenses be rescinded as punishment and said he would continue to have an independent monitor oversee the Trump Organization\u2019s operations.\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the ruling. Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump\u2019s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\n\nBeyond mere bragging about his riches, Trump, his company and key executives repeatedly lied about them on his annual financial statements, reaping rewards such as favorable loan terms and lower insurance premiums, Engoron found.\n\nThose tactics crossed a line and violated the law, the judge said, rejecting Trump\u2019s contention that a disclaimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cIn defendants\u2019 world: rent regulated apartments are worth the same as unregulated apartments; restricted land is worth the same as unrestricted land; restrictions can evaporate into thin air; a disclaimer by one party casting responsibility on another party exonerates the other party\u2019s lies,\u201d Engoron wrote in his 35-page ruling. \u201cThat is a fantasy world, not the real world.\u201d\n\nManhattan prosecutors had looked into bringing a criminal case over the same conduct but declined to do so, leaving James to sue Trump and seek penalties that could disrupt his and his family\u2019s ability to do business in the state.\n\nEngoron\u2019s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James\u2019 lawsuit, but six others remain.\n\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn\u2019t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn\u2019t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nEngoron, noting that he had \u201cemphatically rejected\u201d those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the \u201ctime-loop in the film \u2018Groundhog Day.'\u201d\n\nJames, a Democrat, sued Trump and the Trump Organization a year ago, alleging a pattern of duplicity that she dubbed \u201cthe art of the steal,\u201d a twist on the title of Trump\u2019s 1987 business memoir \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit accused Trump and his company of routinely inflating the value of assets like skyscrapers, golf courses and his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, padding his bottom line by billions.\n\nAmong the allegations were that Trump claimed his Trump Tower apartment in Manhattan \u2014 a three-story penthouse replete with gold-plated fixtures \u2014 was nearly three times its actual size and valued the property at $327 million. No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\n\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth. Trump\u2019s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn\u2019t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn\u2019t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a case and you should drop this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the banks were fully paid? Do you know the banks made a lot of money?\u201d Trump testified. \u201cDo you know I don\u2019t believe I ever got even a default notice, and even during COVID, the banks were all paid? And yet you\u2019re suing on behalf of banks, I guess. It\u2019s crazy. The whole case is crazy.\u201d\n\nEngoron rejected that argument when the defense previously sought to have the case thrown out.\n\nThe judge said the disclaimer on the financial statements \u201cmakes abundantly clear that Mr. Trump was fully responsible for the information contained within\u201d them and that \u201callowing blanket disclaimers to insulate liars from liability would completely undercut\u201d the \u201cimportant function\u201d that such statements serve \u201cin the real world.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit is one of several legal headaches for Trump as he campaigns for a return to the White House in 2024. He has been indicted four times in the last six months \u2014 accused in Georgia and Washington, D.C., of plotting to overturn his 2020 election loss, in Florida of hoarding classified documents, and in Manhattan of falsifying business records related to hush money paid on his behalf.\n\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\n\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills.\n\nJames\u2019 office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests.

    "content": "Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\n\nMar-a-Lago Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It\u2019s fair to say that Trump\u2019s most famous property these days is no longer New York\u2019s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York\u2019s valuation of Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt \u2014 something that Trump denies.\n\nIt\u2019s also a major focus in Trump\u2019s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York\u2019s estimated value \u201cwas a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,\u201d said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. \u201cIt could easily fetch $US500 million or more.\u201d\n\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It\u2019s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump\u2019s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn\u2019t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it\u2019s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing. It took in about $US41 million in revenue last year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent ethics disclosure, compared with $US21 million in 2019. Bloomberg values Mar-a-Lago at $US240 million, based on a combination of comparable residential property sales in the area as well as its value as a business, reflecting some uncertainty around its future status. That uncertainty isn\u2019t shared by everyone. If the city and county allowed it, \u201cthere is no reason why it wouldn\u2019t be able to converted to a full-time private residence,\u201d said Eli Beracha, director of the Hollo School of Real Estate at Florida International University.\n\nTrump\u2019s Fifth Avenue penthouse Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US131.3 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US40 million, New York valuation: No current estimate available Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years, so it\u2019s not surprising that one of the world\u2019s masters of hyperbole exaggerated its size for most of that time. Trump\u2019s penthouse apartment at Trump Tower has been an integral part of his image for 40 years. Credit: AP Between 2011 and 2016, Trump valued his apartment based on it being 30,000 square feet (2,787 square metres) in size \u2014 almost triple its actual measurement of 10,996 square feet. Because of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\n\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views. A better comparison would be a 9450-square-foot penthouse in Olympic Tower, five blocks south on Fifth Avenue, which has been on and off the market for $US35 million since 2016. Then there\u2019s Carl Icahn\u2019s 14,000-square-foot penthouse at Museum Tower on West 53rd Street. It was listed for $US35 million in 2019 before he attempted to split the space and sell it as two separate apartments. Both were eventually delisted.\n\nIt\u2019s possible Trump would get a higher price because of his name. \u201cThere would be a Trump premium because the person that would want that property is likely to be a Trump supporter,\u201d Beracha said. But it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\n\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4.1 million each \u2014 more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units \u201cwith a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump\u2019s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used.\n\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\n\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems. Tenant departures meant occupancy slid to 77 per cent in June, down from 98 per cent in 2015. Its net operating income is only 61 per cent of what was projected by underwriters. Loading \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of leasing velocity down there,\u201d said Albert Sultan, a broker at Kassin Sabbagh Realty. The financial district used to offer a lower cost for tenants, but with Midtown rents declining, \u201cthere\u2019s no reason to go downtown.\u201d The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032 at either 6 per cent of the land value or 85 per cent of its rent in the prior year. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now.",
