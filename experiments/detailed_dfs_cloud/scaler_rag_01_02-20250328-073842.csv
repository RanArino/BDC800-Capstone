","Radically contrasting engagement patterns emerge in different parts of a multi-community space, and this variation is partly explained by the type of identity each community fosters.  For example, established members of distinctive communities engage more with volatile content than outsiders, while the opposite is true in generic communities.

Queries that are likely to be yes/no questions are heuristically identified: we found selecting queries where the first word is in a manually constructed set of indicator words and are of sufficient length, to be effective. Questions are only kept if a Wikipedia page is returned as one of the first five results, in which case the question and Wikipedia page are given to a human annotator for further processing. Annotators label question/article pairs in a three-step process. First, they decide if the question is good, meaning it is comprehensible, unambiguous, and requesting factual information. This judgment is made before the annotator sees the Wikipedia page. Next, for good questions, annotators find a passage within the document that contains enough information to answer the question. Annotators can mark questions as “not answerable"" if the Wikipedia article does not contain the requested information. Finally, annotators mark whether the question's answer is “yes"" or “no""","The dataset was built in three steps: scraping PDF files from the Lok Sabha website, converting the PDFs to text files, and converting the unstructured information into a structured format.  Other datasets (novel-9, novel-50, IMDB62) were constructed using different methods, described in the text.
