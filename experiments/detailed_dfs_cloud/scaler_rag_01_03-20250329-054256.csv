List the laureates and their respective contributions.","Several Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 made significant contributions to quantum theory. Here are the laureates and their specific contributions:  1. **Max Planck (1918)** - Planck is considered the father of quantum theory. He introduced the idea of energy quanta and derived Planck's radiation law, which describes the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body in thermal equilibrium.     2. **Albert Einstein (1921)** - Although awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921, Einstein made crucial contributions to quantum theory with his explanation of the photoelectric effect, which demonstrated the particle nature of light.  3. **Niels Bohr (1922)** - Bohr received his Nobel Prize for his contributions to our understanding of atomic structure and radiation. His Bohr model of the atom incorporated quantum theory and explained how electrons could have stable orbits.  4. **Johannes Stark (1919)** - Stark was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields (the Stark effect), both phenomena that provided insights into atomic structure and quantum mechanics.  5. **James Franck and Gustav Hertz (1925)** - Franck and Hertz's Nobel Prize was awarded for their experiments on electron impacts in atoms, which confirmed quantum energy levels within atoms.","The provided text states that Max Planck received the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of energy quanta, which is a fundamental contribution to quantum theory.  It also mentions that J.J. Thomson (1906) showed electrons are particles, and his son, George Paget Thomson (1937), showed they also have wave properties, but these contributions are not explicitly to *quantum* theory.  No other Nobel laureates in physics between 1901 and 1920 are specifically linked to quantum theory contributions within the provided excerpt.
